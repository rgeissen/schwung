## Module Structure

```
src/modules/your-module/
  module.json              # Required: module metadata
  ui.js                    # Optional: JavaScript UI
  ui_chain.js              # Optional: Signal Chain UI shim
  dsp.so                   # Optional: native DSP plugin

```

## module.json

```json
{
    "id": "your-module",
    "name": "Your Module Name",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "abbrev": "MOD",
    "description": "What your module does",
    "author": "Your Name",
    "ui": "ui.js",
    "ui_chain": "ui_chain.js",
    "dsp": "dsp.so",
    "api_version": 2
}
```

Required fields: `id`, `name`, `version`, `api_version`
Optional fields: `description`, `author`, `ui`, `ui_chain`, `dsp`, `defaults`, `capabilities`, `abbrev`

**Notes:**
- `api_version`: Use `2` for new modules (supports multiple instances, required for Signal Chain)
- `abbrev`: Short display name (3-6 chars) for Shadow UI slot display (e.g., "SF2", "Dexed", "CLAP")
- `module.json` is parsed by a minimal JSON reader. Use double quotes for keys, lowercase `true`/`false`, and avoid comments.
- Keep `module.json` reasonably small (the loader caps it at 8KB).
- `dsp`: any filename inside the module directory — **but only for the standalone/menu load**, which is the only path that reads this field (`module_manager.c`). **Inside Signal Chain the chain host builds the path itself and never consults `module.json`**, using a different rule per component type:

  | `component_type` | What the chain host opens | Source |
  |---|---|---|
  | `sound_generator` | `modules/sound_generators/<id>/**dsp.so**` | `chain_host.c` |
  | `midi_fx` | `modules/midi_fx/<id>/**dsp.so**` | `chain_midi.c` |
  | `audio_fx` | `modules/audio_fx/<id>/**<module-id>.so**` | `chain_host.c` |

  Get it wrong and the module does not load, with **no error on screen** — the only symptom is one line in `debug.log`: `dlopen failed: ... cannot open shared object file`. The failure mode is worth stating because the rules differ: copying an audio FX's build script to make a sound generator produces `<id>.so`, which is correct for the template and silently wrong for the copy. Set `dsp` to match whichever name your type requires, so the two agree.

### Capabilities

Add capability flags to enable special module behaviors. You can group them under
`capabilities` (recommended) or place them at the top level (the host searches
for keys anywhere in `module.json`).

```json
{
    "id": "your-module",
    "name": "Your Module",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "api_version": 1,
    "capabilities": {
        "audio_out": true,
        "midi_in": true,
        "claims_master_knob": true
    }
}
```

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `audio_out` | Module produces audio |
| `audio_in` | Module uses audio input |
| `midi_in` | Module processes MIDI input |
| `midi_out` | Module sends MIDI output (chain MIDI FX, generator tools) |
| `aftertouch` | Module uses aftertouch |
| `claims_master_knob` | Module handles volume knob (CC 79) instead of host |
| `claims_ccs` | A list of CC numbers the module handles while its UI is on screen; they are withheld from Move firmware for that window. See "Claiming buttons" below. |
| `claims_edit_ccs` | Shorthand for `claims_ccs: [56, 60, 119]` — Undo, Copy and Delete. Default off. |
| `raw_midi` | Skip host MIDI transforms (velocity curve, aftertouch filter); module may also bypass internal MIDI filters when set |
| `raw_ui` | Module owns UI input handling; host won't intercept Back to return to menu (use `host_return_to_menu()` to exit) |
| `chainable` | Marks a module as usable inside Signal Chain patches (metadata) |
| `requires_continuous_processing` | Audio FX that owns non-trivial internal time (rolling loopers, granular, modulated delays/reverb). Keeps the slot's DSP rendering through silence instead of idle-parking it after the silence threshold, so the plugin's internal clock doesn't freeze and resume at a wrong offset. Read by `chain_host.c`; null-checked so older chain DSPs still load. |
| `skip_led_clear` | Host skips clearing LEDs on module load/unload — preserves Move's native pad colors (useful for modules that overlay highlights on existing clip colors) |
| `default_forward_channel` | Default Forward Channel for shadow slots loading this module. `-2` = passthrough (preserve original MIDI channel, required for MPE), `1`–`16` = remap to a specific channel. |
| `button_passthrough` | Array of CC numbers the module wants Move to keep handling (e.g. `[85]` to let Play reach Move while the module is active). |
| `suspend_keeps_js` | Tool/overtake modules: pressing Back suspends the UI but the DSP keeps ticking; full exit requires Shift+Back. Useful for sequencers that should keep playing while you browse Move. |
| `component_type` | Module category: `sound_generator`, `audio_fx`, `midi_fx`, `utility`, `system`, `featured`, `overtake`, or `tool` |
| `forks_processes` | Module creates child **processes** (not threads) to do its DSP, as JE-8086 does. See below. |

> **Where these are read.** `src/host/module_manager.c` (used by the
> standalone host runtime) currently parses only `claims_master_knob`,
> `raw_midi`, and `raw_ui`. The remaining flags are honored in the

> for the flag name in `src/schwung_shim.c`, `src/shadow/shadow_ui.{c,js}`,
> and `src/modules/chain/dsp/chain_host.c` to find the consumer.

### `forks_processes`

Set `capabilities.forks_processes: true` when your module's DSP runs in
child **processes** it forks (`fork()`), not threads. It is metadata
only — nothing about how your module runs changes because of this flag.

It exists for the CPU page (`/system/cpu` in schwung-manager, see
`docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md`), which cannot work out ownership from the forked
processes' names: a fork inherits its parent's `comm`, so your children
report as `MoveOriginal` — or worse, as `Audio Main/SPI`, the same name
six of Move's own realtime threads use. The flag tells the page these
processes are yours to attribute.

**Omitting it does not hide your module's cost.** The forked processes
still show up on the page with their real CPU time, just as
"Unattributed" instead of under your module's name.

### Tool Config

Tool modules (`"component_type": "tool"`) appear in the Tools menu and support additional options via `tool_config`:

```json
{
    "tool_config": {
        "interactive": true,
        "skip_file_browser": true
    }
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `interactive` | Tool takes over the UI (like an overtake module) rather than running headlessly |
| `skip_file_browser` | Tool does not use the file browser on launch (goes straight to its own UI) |
| `input_extensions` | Array of file extensions the tool accepts (e.g., `[".wav"]`) |
| `allow_new_file` | Show a "+ New File" action in the file browser |
| `command` | Shell command to run for non-interactive tools |
| `overtake` | `true` to use overtake display mode (full LED clear, ~500ms init delay, Shift+Vol+Jog-Click exit). Default is `false`. |
| `stems` | Array of stem names a separation tool produces, used for the progress readout |
| `processing_ratio` | Wall time as a fraction of the input's duration, used only for the "about N remaining" estimate. `0.5` means a 4-minute file takes about 2 minutes. Default `0.5`. |

Interactive tools use `host_exit_module()` to return to the tools menu when the user presses Back.

**`processing_ratio` is a measurement, not an aspiration, and it should err
LONG.** An estimate that runs out while the tool is still working reads as a
hang; one that finishes early reads as a pleasant surprise.

A tool that ships several engines of different speeds puts a `processing_ratio`
on each entry of `tool_config.engines[]` instead; the per-engine value wins over
the module-level one.

The module-level field went unread for the life of the field — `getToolProcessingRatio()`
consulted only the per-engine value and otherwise returned a hardcoded `0.5`.
It stayed invisible because the single module declaring it declared `0.5`, the
same number as the default, so a working declaration and an ignored one were
indistinguishable. It surfaced only when that module corrected itself to a
measured figure and the on-screen estimate did not move.
`tests/host/test_tool_processing_ratio.sh` now runs both copies of the function
— `shadow_ui.js` drives the confirm screen, `shadow_ui_tools.mjs` the processing
screen — against the same cases and fails if they disagree.

### Defaults

Use `defaults` to pass initial parameters to DSP plugins at load time:

```json
{
    "defaults": {
        "preset": 0,
        "output_level": 50
    }
}
```

## Per-Module Settings

A module that wants user-configurable settings exposed in the
Schwung Manager web UI ships a `settings-schema.json` next to its
`module.json`. schwung-manager auto-discovers it and renders a
Settings section inline on the module's detail page
(`http://move.local:7700/modules/<id>`). Saved values land in
`<module_dir>/config.json`; password-typed fields land in
`<module_dir>/secrets/<key>.txt`. The module reads its own values
at runtime via `host_read_file`.

Available since host **0.9.8** — set `min_host_version` accordingly
in your `module.json` and catalog entry if your module depends on
this system.

### Schema fragment

```json
{
    "id": "your-module",
    "label": "Your Module",
    "items": [
        { "key": "enabled", "label": "Enabled", "type": "bool", "default": true },
        { "key": "mode", "label": "Mode", "type": "enum",
          "options": ["Off", "Low", "High"], "values": ["off", "low", "high"], "default": "off" },
        { "key": "ratio", "label": "Ratio", "type": "float", "min": 0, "max": 1, "step": 0.01, "default": 0.5 },
        { "key": "label", "label": "Label", "type": "string", "default": "" },
        { "key": "system_prompt", "label": "System Prompt", "type": "textarea",
          "rows": 12, "default_source": "default_system_prompt.txt" },
        { "key": "api_key", "label": "API Key", "type": "password",
          "help": "Get a free key at", "help_url": "https://example.com/" }
    ]
}
```

**Required:** the schema's `id` MUST equal the parent directory
name (matches the module's catalog id). Mismatched fragments are
silently dropped at discovery time — this prevents a tampered
schema from impersonating a neighbor module.

**Two layouts are accepted.** The flat shorthand above (single
implicit section), or explicit sections:

```json
{
    "id": "your-module",
    "sections": [
        { "id": "general",  "label": "General",  "items": [...] },
        { "id": "advanced", "label": "Advanced", "items": [...] }
    ]
}
```

### Field types

| Type | Storage | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| `bool` | `config.json` | Renders as a toggle. |
| `enum` | `config.json` | Pair `options[]` (display labels) with `values[]` (saved values). |
| `int` | `config.json` | Supports `min`, `max`, `step`. |
| `float` | `config.json` | Supports `min`, `max`, `step`. |
| `string` | `config.json` | Single-line text input. |
| `textarea` | `config.json` | Multi-line. Set `rows` for height. Use `default_source` to load a default from a file shipped with the module. |
| `password` | `<module>/secrets/<key>.txt` (0600) | Never round-tripped through the web UI. Field shows `••••••••` when set, with an `(×)` button to clear. Optional `help` + `help_url` render under the input. |

Common item fields: `key` (snake_case, required), `label`
(required), `type` (required), `default` (any JSON value matching
the type), `default_source` (textarea only, path relative to the
module dir, must stay inside it).

### Reading values at runtime

The module owns its own defaults — schwung-manager only writes
saved values, never schema defaults. Read your config from
`<module_dir>/config.json`:

```javascript
const MODULE_DIR = "/data/UserData/schwung/modules/tools/your-module";

const cfg = JSON.parse(host_read_file(MODULE_DIR + "/config.json") || "{}");
const enabled = cfg.enabled === undefined ? true : !!cfg.enabled;  // schema default: true
const mode    = cfg.mode || "off";
const ratio   = cfg.ratio === undefined ? 0.5 : cfg.ratio;

const apiKey = (host_read_file(MODULE_DIR + "/secrets/api_key.txt") || "").trim();
```

For a more robust pattern that reads `default` and `default_source`
straight out of the schema and merges them under saved values, see
`src/modules/tools/config-test/ui.js`.

To pick up changes the user makes in the web UI without a reload,
re-read `config.json` periodically from `tick()` (e.g. once a
second).

### Upgrade and uninstall behavior

- `settings-schema.json` is **overwritten** by the new tarball on
  every install/upgrade — it ships with the module and reflects
  the version's feature set.
- `config.json` is **preserved** across upgrades. The user's saved
  values survive.
- `secrets/*.txt` are **preserved** across upgrades. API keys
  survive.
- `default_source` files (e.g. `default_system_prompt.txt`) are
  **overwritten** — they're part of the shipped module.

Uninstall removes the entire module directory atomically — schema,
config, and secrets all go away together.

**Do not ship `config.json` or `secrets/` in your release tarball.**
schwung-manager defends against this by snapshotting and restoring
both before/after extraction, but the cleanest module tarball
contains neither.

### File ownership

schwung-manager runs as root on the device but the module's
`ui.js` runs as `ableton`. schwung-manager `Lchown`s every file
it writes inside a module directory (`config.json`, `secrets/`,
each secret file) to `ableton:users` so the module can read its
own values.

### Build script

If you have files referenced by `default_source`, make sure your
build/packaging includes them. The main repo's `scripts/build.sh`
copies `*.{js,mjs,json,sh,py,txt}` from `src/modules/`; module
repos typically mirror that pattern.

## Remote UI Custom HTML (web_ui.html)

A module that wants a fully custom browser-based UI ships a
`web_ui.html` next to its `module.json`. schwung-manager
auto-discovers it and loads it in a sandboxed iframe on the Remote
UI page (`http://move.local:7700/remote-ui`) whenever that module
is loaded in a shadow slot. The iframe replaces the auto-generated
knob/slider UI for that component.

**Any chain component can supply one** — the synth, an audio FX
(`fx1`/`fx2`), or a MIDI FX (`midi_fx1`). Where it appears differs:

- A **synth** panel takes over the slot view, with the other
  components' sections rendered below it.
- An **audio/MIDI FX** panel renders inside that component's own
  collapsible section, with its own pop-out button, so a slot can
  show a custom synth panel and a custom FX panel at once.

The slot's **Interface: Default** toggle still shows the
auto-generated controls for every component, so a module's own
parameters stay reachable whatever its panel does.

A **Master FX** position works the same way as an audio FX: the panel
renders inside that position's own section, with its own pop-out, and
the Master FX tab has its own Interface toggle. The component there is
`master_fx:fx1` … `master_fx:fx4`, so a panel that builds its keys from
`schwungRemote.component` needs no change to work on the master bus —
one that hardcodes `fx1:` will address a chain slot instead.

**Know which component you are driving.** The manager appends
`?component=<comp>` to the iframe URL and exposes it as
`schwungRemote.component`. Use it to build your parameter keys —
an FX panel must write `fx1:mix`, not `synth:mix`:

```js
var comp = schwungRemote.component || "synth";   // "synth", "fx1", …
schwungRemote.setParam(comp + ":mix", "0.5");
```

`getHierarchy()` and `getChainParams()` already return the metadata
for *your* component, so they need no prefix. A page that ignores
the flag defaults to `synth` and behaves exactly as before.

### File layout

```
modules/<category>/<your-module>/
  module.json
  web_ui.html         # entry point loaded into the iframe
  assets/             # optional: any sibling files (js, css, png, …)
    app.js
    style.css
```

Anything under the module directory is served at
`/api/remote-ui/module-assets/<module-id>/<path>` (see
`handleModuleWebUIAsset` in `schwung-manager/main.go`). Relative
URLs in `web_ui.html` (e.g. `<link href="assets/style.css">`)
resolve against that prefix, so a single module folder is
self-contained.

The asset endpoint rejects `..`, absolute paths, and any
`module.json`/`config.json`/`secrets/` request — those stay
private to the device.

### schwungRemote JavaScript API

schwung-manager exposes a small postMessage bridge to the iframe.
Include the bundled helper to get a Promise-based wrapper:

```html
<script src="/static/schwung-remote-api.js"></script>
<script>
  // Subscribe to parameter changes (hardware knobs, other clients).
  schwungRemote.onParamChange(function (params) {
    // params is { "synth:cutoff": "0.42", ... }
  });

  // Read a single value (resolves with the current cached string).
  schwungRemote.getParam("synth:cutoff").then(function (val) { ... });

  // Write a value. Fire-and-forget; goes straight to the device.
  schwungRemote.setParam("synth:cutoff", "0.75");

  // Read structural metadata once on load.
  schwungRemote.getHierarchy().then(function (hier) { ... });   // ui_hierarchy
  schwungRemote.getChainParams().then(function (params) { ... }); // chain_params array
</script>
```

| Method | Direction | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| `onParamChange(cb)` | device → iframe | Subscribes the iframe to all `param_update` messages for the active slot. Includes hardware knob changes and updates from other browser clients. |
| `getParam(key)` | local cache | Returns the **last value the iframe has seen** for `key`, not a fresh device read. If you need a value before any update has arrived, call `onParamChange` first and seed from the initial burst. |
| `setParam(key, value)` | iframe → device | Goes through the WebSocket `set_param` path. Value is coerced to a string. |
| `getHierarchy()` | local cache | Returns the parsed `ui_hierarchy` object for **your** component (or `null` if the module didn't expose one). |
| `getChainParams()` | local cache | Returns the parsed `chain_params` array for **your** component (or `null`). |
| `component` | property | The chain component this page drives — `"synth"`, `"fx1"`, `"fx2"`, `"midi_fx1"`. Use it to build parameter keys. |

**Param keys are component-prefixed.** Use `"synth:cutoff"`, not
`"cutoff"` — and build the prefix from `schwungRemote.component`
rather than hardcoding `synth`, or your page will only work in a
synth slot. Slot-level keys like `slot:volume` and `knob_1_value`
also flow through `onParamChange` if you want to mirror the
slot/knob state.

### Iframe sandbox

The iframe is created with `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"`.
That means:
- `<script>` runs and `fetch`/`XHR` to same-origin URLs works.
- No top-level navigation, popups, form submission, or pointer
  lock — design the UI to stay in-frame.
- No access to the parent window beyond `window.parent.postMessage`,
  which is exactly what `schwungRemote` uses.

### Minimal example

```html
<!doctype html>
<html><head><meta charset="utf-8"><title>My Module</title>
<style>
  body { font-family: system-ui; margin: 1em; }
  input[type=range] { width: 100%; }
</style>
</head><body>
  <label>Cutoff <input id="cutoff" type="range" min="0" max="1" step="0.01"></label>

  <script src="/static/schwung-remote-api.js"></script>
  <script>
    // Works in a synth slot or an FX slot: the host says which.
    const comp = schwungRemote.component || "synth";
    const key = comp + ":cutoff";

    const cutoff = document.getElementById("cutoff");
    cutoff.addEventListener("input", () => {
      schwungRemote.setParam(key, cutoff.value);
    });
    schwungRemote.onParamChange((params) => {
      if (params[key] !== undefined) {
        cutoff.value = params[key];
      }
    });
  </script>
</body></html>
```

### Notes

- The custom UI **adds to**, not replaces, the hardware UI on the
  Move display. Modules still need a working `ui.js` (or a chain
  shim) — the iframe only affects the browser view.
- `web_ui.html` is reloaded whenever the slot's synth module
  changes. Persist any iframe-side UI state via `setParam` or
  your own storage; don't rely on the iframe surviving slot swaps.
- Available since schwung-manager landed the Remote UI custom
  HTML support (see `docs/plans/2026-04-08-remote-ui-plan.md`
  Task 5). Bump `min_host_version` in your catalog entry if your
  module depends on it.

#### A panel is not the synth's privilege, and it must not open FOLDED

Any component may ship a `web_ui.html` — a MIDI FX and an audio FX get theirs
rendered inside that component's own section, and a Master FX position gets one
too. Two rules the client had to learn the hard way, both worth knowing if you
are authoring a non-synth panel:

- **A section's fold state is DERIVED, not seeded.** It used to be a literal —
  `collapsed: { synth: false, fx1: true, fx2: true, midi_fx1: true }` — written
  when every non-synth section was generated rows, where folding saves space.
  A component that ships a panel is a different thing: folding hides the entire
  feature behind a one-line disclosure triangle and nothing on screen says a
  panel is there. Stacks shipped that way and read as "the Remote UI does not
  work", while the manager was serving the file correctly the whole time and
  every layer reported success. `sectionCollapsed()` now stores only what the
  USER chose and derives the rest, because the right default depends on the
  `custom_ui` message, which arrives *after* the slot state is built.
- **One draw order, and it is signal flow** (`COMPONENT_ORDER`: midi_fx1,
  synth, fx1, fx2). The two render paths each carried their own list, so with a
  custom synth panel loaded the MIDI FX drew LAST — below a panel that measures
  itself at ~3000px.

And a trap on the panel's own side: the parent sizes your iframe from the
height you report (`body.scrollHeight`, auto-reported by
`schwung-remote-api.js`), so **never make a layout decision from a media query
that reads your own height.** `(orientation:portrait)` is the one to avoid — a
tall frame reads as portrait, portrait stacks, stacking makes you taller, and
the taller height is reported straight back. Stacks latched at a 2817px column
that way. Query `max-width` instead: the parent sets your width, so it cannot
be fed back, and an iPad held upright is 768–834pt wide and lands under a
900px breakpoint anyway.

`tests/host/test_remote_ui_panel_visible.sh` pins both client rules.

#### A widget's `viz.extra_keys` reaches the browser too

The knob grid has always read `viz.extra_keys` — the way a widget names a value
that owns no cell of its own. The Remote UI never did, so a module whose panel
is *driven* by one worked on the device and went blind in the browser. Stacks
is the case: its whole progression arrives as the extra key `prog`, so the
panel drew no chord slots and no add button, with nothing to say why — an
unfetched key is indistinguishable from an empty one.

Two things had to change in the manager, and the second is the one that hides:

- `chainParam` parses `viz.extra_keys`, and every path that completes an
  initial value send fetches them. There are **three**, and a fix to only the
  streaming one is invisible: the `state` fast path returns early.
- That fast path's test used to be "does `state` parse as a JSON object". A
  module's state is an OPAQUE save blob, perfectly entitled to be an object
  without being a param map — stacks returns `{"s": "v6|9|2|..."}`. It parsed,
  so the fast path "succeeded", pushed one useless key and skipped the sweep of
  all 53 real params. `stateCoversParams` now requires the snapshot to contain
  at least one key the component actually declares.

#### `grid-auto-rows: min-content`, and why one line caused two opposite bugs

With `auto` rows the tracks are sized against the pane's own height once the
content outgrows it, so a row comes out SHORTER than the card in it. That
single fault presents two ways depending only on `align-self`, which is why it
was fixed twice and neither fix held: stretched, the card is squeezed and
`overflow:hidden` eats the bottom of its list -- content you can see past and
cannot scroll to, which reads as a broken scroller; started, the card keeps its
height and SPILLS into the row below, drawing over the controls there.
`min-content` tracks are sized by their contents and never by leftover space.

Run `tools/stacks/check_panel_layout.py <host>` after any layout change: it
audits every bank at four viewport sizes for overlap, clipping, escape, a
last-card that scrolling cannot reach, and nested scrollers. Each of those
checks exists because that fault shipped.

#### A long action must report, and the report belongs to the ACTION

Read Clip and Stamp Clip hand their work to a worker thread and return
immediately — that is the realtime rule, not a shortcut — so `status`
(`idle`/`working`/`ok`/`failed`) becomes its verdict some time *after* the write
that started it. The host re-reads a component's params once, ~250ms after a
write, so a panel that reads it then always reads it too early: the button
reports nothing and a failure looks exactly like a success. Poll with
`resubscribe()` while a job could be in flight.

Then display it against the ACTION, not the value. `status` **latches** — it
stays `ok` until the next job begins — so keying the display on the value
changing means a second successful stamp shows nothing at all, `ok → ok` being
no change. The window opens when the user presses something and closes a few
seconds after the module answers, with a timeout so a module that never
answers doesn't pin `WORKING` on screen forever.

#### A stamp writes the clip's LENGTH as well as its notes

The splice replaced `notes` and nothing else, so the clip kept whatever length
it already had — a fresh one is a single bar — and a four-bar progression was
written three bars past the loop end. Every note was in the file and the clip
played one bar of them, which reads as "the stamp lost my music". `region.end`
and `region.loop.end` are rewritten in place as two more number-sized splices,
never by re-emitting the region object: same rule as the notes array, since a
set carries a great deal this module does not understand. A clip with no
`region` (an older schema) is left alone and still gets its notes.

#### `write file` races Move, and Move wins

Move holds the set in memory and autosaves over it, so a spliced `Song.abl` can
be silently replaced — observed: 14 notes written at 11:58, the file rewritten
by Move at 12:09 with the notes gone. That is why `stamp_mode` defaults to
**rec arm**. `write file` is opt-in and only safe when Move will not write that
set before you reload it.

#### The lap begins on Move's downbeat, not on the button press

`stamp` in rec-arm mode used to set `pulse = 0` the instant it was pressed,
which puts the module's bar 1 wherever the finger landed while Move's clock
carries on at its own position. A recorded lap then lined up only by luck, and
no amount of care at the two ends could fix it — the user is being asked to
synchronise two human-timed events on a downbeat.

The press ARMS instead, and the transport says when: a MIDI Start is a downbeat
by definition, and on an already-running clock the next bar line is
`pulse % BAR_CLOCKS == 0`. Zeroing `pulse` there is what puts chord 1 on that
bar, and it is what Start already did, so the two grids agree from that moment.
A Stop cancels the arm, or it fires on the next unrelated transport start.

The panel owns the ARMED indicator, because the module publishes no such state
and the alternative is a button that looks dead: pressing it starts nothing, so
without a word on screen there is nothing between the press and the transport.

#### Stamp means two different things, and the button must say which

`stamp_mode` defaults to **rec arm**, which writes no file: it restarts the
progression and plays ONE LAP for Move to record into an armed track. Pressed
with nothing armed it is silent, and is indistinguishable from a broken stamp —
which is exactly what it was taken for. Only `write file` splices `Song.abl`.
The button is labelled from the mode.

#### An action is the button, not a card containing its own name

A write-trigger rendered as a labelled card holding a button says the name
twice — "Clear" above `CLEAR`, "Stamp Clip" above `STAMP CLIP` — and spends a
card's chrome doing it. Six of those was most of the CLIP bank's height saying
nothing new. The button takes the card's frame instead, so it reads as one
control and the label sits where it always was: on the thing you press. CLIP
went from 617px to 270px, which is the difference between scrolling that bank
and seeing it.

Two more that only show on a narrow rail: a stretched stepper puts `−` and `+`
at opposite ends with the number marooned between them, so cap and centre the
row; and a control whose card is a third of the rail cannot afford full-size
stepper buttons — measure the value's `scrollWidth` against its box, because
the failure is a number clipped to a sliver rather than anything that looks
broken.

#### A long list scrolls inside its own cell

Cap it and let it scroll in place, so every cell on the bank stays in view and
only the one with more content moves. Removing the cap makes that cell grow to
its content and push the rest of the bank off screen, which forces you to
scroll the whole pane to reach a control you could otherwise see.

This was banned once, and the ban was aimed at the wrong thing. The
rubber-band — a list visible past the cell's edge that no drag could reach, the
gesture landing on the pane's overscroll and springing back — came from
`grid-auto-rows: auto` sizing a row SHORTER than the card in it, so
`overflow:hidden` clipped the scroller while the scroller itself had nothing to
scroll. With `min-content` rows the card always holds its scroller. Give the
scroller `overscroll-behavior: contain` as well, or a flick that reaches the
end is handed to the pane, which is what makes two nested scrollers feel like
one gesture being fought over.

The invariant worth checking is not "no nested scrollers" — it is that a
scroller is never clipped by its card and can always reach its end and its last
item. `tools/stacks/check_panel_layout.py` asserts exactly that.

#### One question, one function: how loud is this note

`humanised_velocity()` answers a DEVIATION around the global velocity and knows
nothing about a chord's own Chord Vel offset. Playback folded that back in by
hand; the STAMP did not, and wrote the deviation straight into the clip. A
chord at Chord Vel -63 therefore played quiet and stamped at full level --
contradicting the one thing Stamp promises, that the clip is the take Preview
played, and invisible until the clip is heard later without the module.
`note_velocity()` is now the only caller, used by playback, the stamp and the
wire; `tests/host/test_stacks_note_velocity_single_source.sh` fails when a
second caller appears, which is the shape the bug had.

#### v13: a velocity per note, because humanise is per note

The wire carried one velocity per chord, so a per-note deviation was
unrepresentable: pressing Randomize genuinely changed the take and nothing
moved on either screen, which reads as a dead button. v13 writes
`note:velocity`; v12 wrote `note`. Both parsers accept BOTH, deliberately -- a
DSP that has not been reloaded still publishes v12, and copying a module's
files does not reload it, so the two versions coexist on a device in the
ordinary course of an update. An absent velocity falls back to the chord's,
which is exactly what v12 meant.

#### Two parsers for one wire format will disagree

`canvas_script` is a single standalone script in QuickJS and the panel is an
HTML page, so this module genuinely cannot share a parser at runtime. The
copies stay, and `tests/host/test_stacks_prog_parsers_agree.sh` makes them
answer for each other by RUNNING both over a corpus — not by comparing source
text, which would fail on formatting and pass on the bug that actually shipped
(`Number("")` is `0`, `parseInt("")` is `NaN`, so one parser read every rest as
carrying a note at pitch 0). Anything else derived from a table in the DSP is
GENERATED rather than retyped: `tools/stacks/gen_ui_runs.py` writes both grouping
tables into `module.json` — shape→family and genre→progression — pinned by
`tests/host/test_stacks_ui_runs.sh`. Two pickers narrow a long list by a
shorter one beside it, and both groupings already exist in C as contiguous
runs, so neither boundary is retyped into the panel. They filter differently on
purpose: Shape Family is CUMULATIVE (a 7th contains a triad), Genre is
EXCLUSIVE (Rock does not contain Pop).

### Remote UI for overtake tools (the Tool tab)

Overtake tools (dsp.so loaded by the shim as `overtake_dsp`, not a chain slot)
get their own browser view: schwung-manager serves the tool's `web_ui.html`
under the **Tool tab**, addressed via the `overtake_dsp:<key>` param prefix.

- **Opt in** by answering `get_param("module_id")` with your module id. The
  manager probes it to discover the active tool, announces arrival/departure
  to open Tool tabs, and serves `web_ui.html` from your module folder.
- **Reads**: the manager seeds and refreshes the browser from
  `get_param("state")` — return a **flat JSON object of delimited string
  values** (nested arrays/objects are dropped by the param explosion).
- **Writes**: browser `setParam` calls with values under 256 bytes arrive as
  ordinary `set_param` dispatched from the shim's **web-set ring drain**
  (lossless, ~one SPI frame, immune to param-mailbox contention); larger
  values take the shadow_param mailbox (serialized round-trip, up to 64 KB).
  **No per-buffer coalescing** on either path (unlike the on-device JS
  channel). Ordering across the two paths is not guaranteed — keep any
  op-sequencing within one size class.
- **Off-audio-thread snapshots (optional)**: answer
  `get_param("remote_snapshot_rt_safe")` with `"1"` and the host serializes
  your `"state"` snapshot on a low-priority worker thread into a cached,
  rev-stamped double buffer; the audio thread then serves browser pulls with
  a single memcpy instead of running your serializer in the SPI frame budget.
  **Contract:** every byte of instance memory reachable by your `"state"` /
  `"rui_poll"` get_param must stay valid for the LIFETIME of the instance —
  never freed or realloc'd by `render_block` OR `set_param` (frees only in
  `destroy_instance`; use grow-only / clear-and-keep pools). Torn or
  one-rev-stale snapshots are acceptable (the manager re-pulls until the
  snapshot's own rev matches the digest); a use-after-free is not. Include
  your current rev in the `"state"` JSON so the manager can tell what it
  received. Note: a BULK_GET (request_type 3) of `"state"` bypasses this
  cache and runs your serializer on the audio thread — don't put `"state"`
  in bulk reads if you opt in.
- **Live sync (optional but recommended)**: expose a monotonic edit counter
  and a cheap digest, and the host pushes changes to the browser on-change:
  - `get_param("rui_poll")` → `rev:on:tick:bpm[:devms]` — `rev` bumps on every
    snapshot-visible edit; `on/tick/bpm` describe transport; `devms` (playing
    only — the stopped digest must stay byte-stable) is a free-running
    device-clock ms that lets the browser time-base its playhead independent
    of delivery latency. The shim probes this in-process every few frames and
    pushes changes through the notify ring; without it the manager falls back
    to polling.
  - Key-naming convention: keys suffixed `_ruisel` / `_cc_focus` and the key
    `transport` are treated as selection/transport (the manager echoes
    snapshots to their sender immediately instead of applying the editing
    quiet-window).

## Drop-In Modules

Modules are discovered at runtime from `/data/UserData/schwung/modules`.
To add a new module, copy a folder with `module.json` (plus `ui.js` and `dsp.so`
if needed) and either restart Schwung or call `host_rescan_modules()` in
your UI. No host recompile is required for new modules or UI updates.

## JavaScript UI (ui.js)

Module UIs are loaded as ES modules, so you can import shared utilities:

```javascript
import {
    MoveMainKnob, MoveShift, MoveMenu,
    MovePad1, MovePad32,
    MidiNoteOn, MidiCC
} from '../../shared/constants.mjs';

/* Module state */
let counter = 0;

/* Called once when module loads */
globalThis.init = function() {
    console.log("Module starting...");
    clear_screen();
    print(2, 2, "Hello Move!", 2);
}

/* Called every frame (~60fps) */
globalThis.tick = function() {
    // Update display here
}

/* Handle MIDI from external USB devices */
globalThis.onMidiMessageExternal = function(data) {
    // data = [status, data1, data2]
}

/* Handle MIDI from Move hardware */
globalThis.onMidiMessageInternal = function(data) {
    const isNoteOn = data[0] === 0x90;
    const note = data[1];
    const velocity = data[2];

    // Ignore capacitive touch from knobs
    if (note < 10) return;

    // Handle pad press
    if (isNoteOn && note >= 68 && note <= 99) {
        console.log("Pad pressed: " + note);
    }
}
```

### Signal Chain UI Shims

Modules can expose a full-screen UI when used as a Signal Chain MIDI source by
adding `ui_chain.js` (or setting `"ui_chain"` in `module.json` to a different
filename). The file should set `globalThis.chain_ui`:

```javascript
globalThis.chain_ui = {
    init,
    tick,
    onMidiMessageInternal,
    onMidiMessageExternal
};
```

Do not override `globalThis.init` or `globalThis.tick` in `ui_chain.js`.
Make sure to ship `ui_chain.js` in your build/install step if you use it.
The host itself ignores `ui_chain`; it is consumed by the Signal Chain UI when
loading a MIDI source module.

Example `ui_chain.js` wrapper:

```javascript
import {
    init,
    tick,
    onMidiMessageInternal,
    onMidiMessageExternal
} from './ui_core.mjs';

globalThis.chain_ui = {
    init,
    tick,
    onMidiMessageInternal,
    onMidiMessageExternal
};
```

#### If your `ui_chain.js` draws the knob grid (`param_pages`)

A module may bind Schwung's own page engine instead of drawing its own screens
— import `page_controller.mjs` from `/data/UserData/schwung/shared/param_pages/`
and you get the whole knob grid, the widgets, the viz graphics, the section
picker and the gestures for free.

**Then two calls are yours, not one:**

```javascript
clear_screen();                                   /* the frame is YOURS */
controller.render(ctx, { title: title() });
controller.renderOverlays(ctx, { clearScreen: clear_screen });
```

The library never clears the screen — that is what lets `render()` place a page
inside a rect you own — so anything full-screen is handed back to you.
Today that is the enum peek: turn a multi-option enum and its option list
should rise over the grid for ~700 ms. Skip `renderOverlays` and the controller
still tracks the peek and still swallows the Back that dismisses it; it is
simply never painted, with no error anywhere. Two shipped modules had exactly
that bug.

#### Back-button handling (`handleBack`)

A chain module's `ui_chain.js` may export `handleBack()`. When the shadow UI is in
COMPONENT_EDIT with your module's chain UI loaded, a Back press calls your
`handleBack()` first:

- return a **truthy** value to **consume** Back (you handled internal navigation
  — e.g. popped your own sub-view);
- return **falsy** / omit the method to let the host handle Back (unload the module
  UI and return to the chain editor).

Only consume Back while you actually have somewhere to go back *to*. If `handleBack()`
always returns truthy the user can never leave your module via Back — it is the only
host-processed exit in this screen, so the sole remaining way out is to exit shadow mode.

#### Taking the pads (`host_pad_block`)

`host_pad_block(1)` stops pad notes (68–99) reaching Move firmware and forwards
them to whatever UI is on screen; `host_pad_block(0)` gives them back. Pad LEDs
are written with `move_midi_internal_send([0x09, 0x90, note, colour])` — the
same note carries input and colour.

**It is a GLOBAL switch, not a per-module one.** While it is set, no module
sees the pads, so two rules apply and neither is optional:

- **Take it while visible, not once.** The host releases it whenever nothing on
  screen wants the pads — including when the shadow display is dismissed — so a
  UI that claims the pads in an open hook and never again finds them gone after
  the user leaves and returns. Assert it every frame you are drawn; the call is
  one SHM byte and is idempotent.
- **Release means GIVING THE LEDS BACK, not darkening them.** Move writes a pad
  LED only when its *own* value changes, so a grid left blank stays blank on
  that track — the pads respond and are invisible, which reads as "the pads are
  dead". The shim mirrors Move's pad state into overlay SHM continuously;
  `shadow_get_pad_led_snapshot()` reads it. The host restores from that on
  release, so a module should simply stop writing pad LEDs and let it.

#### Claiming buttons (`capabilities.claims_ccs`, `claims_edit_ccs`)

Move's buttons reach Move firmware by default and are **not** forwarded to
modules. A module that wants some of them for its own gestures opts in:

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "claims_edit_ccs": true,
    "claims_ccs": [85, 58]
  }
}
```

`claims_edit_ccs: true` is shorthand for Undo (CC 56), Copy (CC 60) and
Delete (CC 119) — the drum-rack trio. `claims_ccs` lists any others by CC
number; the two combine.

While that module's UI is on screen, a claimed button is delivered to the
module (a `type: "canvas"` UI receives it in `onMidi`; on the knob grid Undo,
Copy and Delete drive the instance copy/clear gesture under *Child Selectors*)
**and withheld from Move firmware**, so a press cannot double-fire into Move's
own action — hold Copy and tap a pad without also copying the Move clip behind
the screen. The claim applies on the knob grid, the hierarchy editor, the
component edit/params screens, and a canvas UI (fullscreen or co-run overlay).
Leave any of those and the buttons return to Move immediately; the shim also
drops every claim on its own when the shadow display closes, so a shadow UI
that exits without reconciling cannot strand one.

> **A SHIFT-HELD PRESS IS NEVER DELIVERED TO A CLAIMED CC.** `Shift+<button>`
> is the host's own vocabulary — Shift+Copy and Shift+Delete are the
> snapshot/recall gesture — so the shim withholds a shift-held press from the

> **Opt-in is the whole point.** #154 withheld Undo/Copy/Delete unconditionally

**What cannot be claimed.** The controls the host itself owns are refused by
the shim whatever a module lists, and the shadow UI logs the refusal: Shift,
Menu and Back (how you leave a screen), the jog wheel and click, the eight
knobs and the master knob, the four track buttons, Mute (Move-native Mute+Pad
depends on it reaching firmware), and the two jack-detect CCs. Everything
else is the module's to claim, transport included: a module that claims Play
(CC 85) takes Move's transport button away while its UI is up, which is what
a claim means.

**Shift is the host's.** A press with Shift held is never claimed:
Shift+Copy / Shift+Delete stay the host's snapshot and recall over a claiming
module, and a module gets the bare buttons only.

Press/release pairing is latched per button: whoever receives the press also
receives the release, even if the claim changes mid-hold. Neither Move nor the
module can be left believing a button is still held.

### Menu Layout Helpers

For list-based screens (title/list/footer), use the shared menu layout helpers:

```javascript
import {
    drawMenuHeader,
    drawMenuList,
    drawMenuFooter,
    menuLayoutDefaults
} from '../../shared/menu_layout.mjs';

const items = [
    { label: "Velocity", value: "Hard" },
    { label: "Aftertouch", value: "On" }
];

drawMenuHeader("Settings");
drawMenuList({
    items,
    selectedIndex,
    listArea: {
        topY: menuLayoutDefaults.listTopY,
        bottomY: menuLayoutDefaults.listBottomWithFooter
    },
    valueAlignRight: true,
    getLabel: (item) => `${item.label}:`,
    getValue: (item) => item.value
});
drawMenuFooter("Back:back  </>:change");
```

`drawMenuList` will derive row count from the list area and scroll automatically. When `valueAlignRight` is enabled, labels are truncated with `...` if they would overlap the value.

## Menu System

For modules that need hierarchical settings menus, the shared menu system provides a complete solution for navigation, input handling, and rendering.

### Menu Item Types

Import factory functions from `menu_items.mjs`:

```javascript
import {
    MenuItemType,
    createSubmenu,
    createValue,
    createEnum,
    createToggle,
    createAction,
    createBack,
    formatItemValue,
    isEditable
} from '../../shared/menu_items.mjs';
```

| Type | Factory | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `SUBMENU` | `createSubmenu(label, getMenu)` | Navigate to child menu |
| `VALUE` | `createValue(label, {get, set, min, max, step, fineStep, format})` | Numeric value with range |
| `ENUM` | `createEnum(label, {get, set, options, format})` | Cycle through string options |
| `TOGGLE` | `createToggle(label, {get, set, onLabel, offLabel})` | Boolean on/off |
| `ACTION` | `createAction(label, onAction)` | Execute callback on click |
| `BACK` | `createBack(label)` | Return to parent menu |

Example menu definition:

```javascript
function getSettingsMenu() {
    return [
        createEnum('Velocity', {
            get: () => host_get_setting('velocity_curve'),
            set: (v) => { host_set_setting('velocity_curve', v); host_save_settings(); },
            options: ['linear', 'soft', 'hard', 'full']
        }),
        createValue('AT Deadzone', {
            get: () => host_get_setting('aftertouch_deadzone'),
            set: (v) => { host_set_setting('aftertouch_deadzone', v); host_save_settings(); },
            min: 0, max: 50, step: 5, fineStep: 1
        }),
        createToggle('Aftertouch', {
            get: () => host_get_setting('aftertouch_enabled') === 1,
            set: (v) => { host_set_setting('aftertouch_enabled', v ? 1 : 0); host_save_settings(); }
        }),
        createSubmenu('Advanced', () => getAdvancedMenu()),
        createBack()
    ];
}
```

### Menu Navigation

The `menu_nav.mjs` module handles all input for menu navigation:

```javascript
import { createMenuState, handleMenuInput } from '../../shared/menu_nav.mjs';
import { createMenuStack } from '../../shared/menu_stack.mjs';

const menuState = createMenuState();
const menuStack = createMenuStack();

// Initialize with root menu
menuStack.push({ title: 'Settings', items: getSettingsMenu() });

// In onMidiMessageInternal:
function onMidiMessageInternal(data) {
    if ((data[0] & 0xF0) === 0xB0) {  // CC message
        const cc = data[1];
        const value = data[2];
        const current = menuStack.current();

        const result = handleMenuInput({
            cc, value,
            items: current.items,
            state: menuState,
            stack: menuStack,
            shiftHeld: isShiftHeld,
            onBack: () => host_return_to_menu()
        });

        if (result.needsRedraw) {
            redraw();
        }
    }
}
```

**Navigation behavior:**
- **Jog wheel**: Scroll list (navigation) or adjust value (editing)
- **Jog click**: Enter submenu, start/confirm edit, execute action
- **Up/Down arrows**: Scroll list
- **Left/Right arrows**: Quick-adjust values without entering edit mode
- **Back button**: Cancel edit or go back in menu stack

### Encoder Acceleration

When editing numeric values with the jog wheel, acceleration provides smooth control:

```javascript
import { decodeDelta, decodeAcceleratedDelta } from '../../shared/input_filter.mjs';

// Simple delta (±1) for navigation
const delta = decodeDelta(ccValue);

// Accelerated delta for value editing
// Slow turns = step 1, fast turns = step up to 10
const accelDelta = decodeAcceleratedDelta(ccValue, 'my_encoder');
```

- Slow turns (<150ms between events): step = 1 (fine control)
- Fast turns (<25ms between events): step = 10 (coarse control)
- In between: interpolated step size
- Hold **Shift** for fine control (always step 1)

### Text Scrolling

Long labels automatically scroll after a delay:

```javascript
import { createTextScroller, getMenuLabelScroller } from '../../shared/text_scroll.mjs';

// Use singleton for menu labels
const scroller = getMenuLabelScroller();

// In tick():
scroller.setSelected(selectedIndex);  // Reset scroll on selection change
if (scroller.tick()) {
    redraw();  // Scroll position changed
}

// When rendering:
const displayText = scroller.getScrolledText(fullLabel, maxChars);
```

**Scroll behavior:**
- 2 second delay before scrolling starts
- ~100ms between scroll steps
- 2 second pause at end, then reset

### Menu Stack

For hierarchical menus with back navigation:

```javascript
import { createMenuStack } from '../../shared/menu_stack.mjs';

const stack = createMenuStack();

// Push root menu
stack.push({ title: 'Main', items: mainMenuItems });

// Navigate to submenu
stack.push({ title: 'Settings', items: settingsItems, selectedIndex: 0 });

// Go back
stack.pop();

// Get current menu
const current = stack.current();  // { title, items, selectedIndex }

// Get breadcrumb path
const path = stack.getPath();  // ['Main', 'Settings']
```

## Native DSP Plugin

For audio synthesis/processing, create a native plugin implementing the C API.

### Threading: there is no control thread

**Read this before writing a line of DSP.** Every plugin entry point runs on the
SPI audio callback — SCHED_FIFO 90, core 3, ~900 µs of budget per block:

| Entry point | Runs on the SPI callback? |
|---|---|
| `create_instance` / `destroy_instance` | **yes** |
| `set_param` | **yes** |
| `get_param` | **yes** |
| `on_midi` / `process_midi` | **yes** |
| `render_block` / `process_block` / `tick` | **yes** |

There is no separate control thread, no UI thread, and no "MIDI thread". A
2026-08 audit of all 113 catalogued modules found ~150 confirmed realtime
violations, and several came with comments asserting the opposite — *"control
thread only (blocking dir + file I/O)"*, *"run on the control thread, NEVER from
process_block — so this malloc is realtime-safe"*, *"safe because it runs in the
MIDI callback (not the RT render thread)"*. Each of those produced a
multi-megabyte blocking operation on the audio thread.

**Never, in any of the calls above:**

- file I/O — `fopen`/`fread`/`fwrite`/`open`/`stat`/`opendir`/`readdir`/`mkdir`
- allocation or free — `malloc`/`calloc`/`realloc`/`free`/`new`/`delete`
- locks held by a non-realtime thread
- `fork`/`exec`/`system`/`popen`/`dlopen`
- logging, including `host->log` **and a bare `fprintf(stderr, …)`** — stderr is
  unbuffered, so that is a `write()` syscall even when your debug flag is off
- unbounded work: an FFT, a whole-buffer `memset`, a directory sort

The symptom is not a glitch in your module: it is a **device-wide** audio
dropout, because you are holding the thread that services every other module's
audio and Move's own.

#### Threads inherit SCHED_FIFO 90

`pthread_create()` from any of those entry points gives your worker the audio
callback's realtime priority. Move's own `Link Main` publisher runs at **FIFO
35**, so an inherited-priority worker starves Move's audio and causes the very
dropouts you went off-thread to avoid. Demote as the worker's first action:

```c
static void *worker(void *arg) {
    struct sched_param sp = { .sched_priority = 0 };
    sched_setscheduler(0, SCHED_OTHER, &sp);      /* MUST be first */

    cpu_set_t set; CPU_ZERO(&set);                 /* keep core 3 free for SPI */
    CPU_SET(0, &set); CPU_SET(1, &set); CPU_SET(2, &set);
    sched_setaffinity(0, sizeof(set), &set);
    ...
}
```

References that do this correctly: `schwung-keydetect`
(`keyfinder_wrapper.cpp`) and `schwung-airwindows` (`clap_fx.cpp`,
`loader_thread_fn`). The audit found at least 14 modules that do not.

#### What to do instead

Load files, allocate buffers and build lists on your own `SCHED_OTHER` worker,
and publish the result to the audio path as a pointer swap. Keep `get_param`
cheap in particular — a `get_param` that rescans a directory is served on the
audio thread **once per repaint**, not once per click, so it is worse than the
equivalent `set_param`. Seven modules in the audit had exactly that bug.

See `docs/REALTIME_SAFETY.md` for the measurements.

### Plugin API v2 (Recommended)

V2 supports multiple instances and is **required for Signal Chain integration**:

```c
#include "host/plugin_api_v1.h"  /* v2 API is defined in this file */

typedef struct my_instance {
    // Your synth state here
    float sample_rate;
    int preset;
} my_instance_t;

static void* create_instance(const char *module_dir, const char *json_defaults) {
    my_instance_t *inst = calloc(1, sizeof(my_instance_t));
    inst->sample_rate = 44100.0f;
    // Parse json_defaults if needed
    return inst;
}

static void destroy_instance(void *instance) {
    free(instance);
}

static void on_midi(void *instance, const uint8_t *msg, int len, int source) {
    my_instance_t *inst = (my_instance_t*)instance;
    // source: 0 = internal (Move), 1 = external (USB)
}

static void set_param(void *instance, const char *key, const char *val) {
    my_instance_t *inst = (my_instance_t*)instance;
    // Handle parameter changes
}

static int get_param(void *instance, const char *key, char *buf, int buf_len) {
    my_instance_t *inst = (my_instance_t*)instance;
    // Return parameter value, ui_hierarchy, chain_params, etc.
    return -1;
}

static void render_block(void *instance, int16_t *out_lr, int frames) {
    my_instance_t *inst = (my_instance_t*)instance;
    // Generate 'frames' stereo samples
    // Output format: [L0, R0, L1, R1, ...]
}

/* Export the plugin API */
static plugin_api_v2_t api = {
    .api_version = 2,
    .create_instance = create_instance,
    .destroy_instance = destroy_instance,
    .on_midi = on_midi,
    .set_param = set_param,
    .get_param = get_param,
    .render_block = render_block,
};

plugin_api_v2_t* move_plugin_init_v2(const host_api_v1_t* host) {
    return &api;
}
```

### Runtime Modulation Callbacks (Chain Host)

When a plugin runs inside Signal Chain, `host_api_v1_t` may provide optional modulation callbacks:

```c
int (*mod_emit_value)(void *ctx,
                      const char *source_id,
                      const char *target,
                      const char *param,
                      float signal,
                      float depth,
                      float offset,
                      int bipolar,
                      int enabled);
void (*mod_clear_source)(void *ctx, const char *source_id);
void *mod_host_ctx;
```

Use these to publish temporary modulation overlays without overwriting a target parameter's saved base value.

Guidelines:
- `source_id`: stable ID for the modulation source instance/lane.
- `target`: `"synth"`, `"fx1"`, `"fx2"`, `"midi_fx1"`, or `"midi_fx2"`.
- `enabled=0` or `mod_clear_source(...)`: clears that source's contribution.
- Missing/stale targets should fail silently (do not crash or spam logs).
- Multiple sources can target the same parameter; the host sums contributions and clamps to target range.

### Plugin API v1 (Deprecated)

V1 is a singleton API - only one instance can exist. **Do not use for new modules:**

```c
#include "plugin_api_v1.h"

static int on_load(const char *module_dir, const char *json_defaults) {
    return 0;  // 0 = success
}

static void on_unload(void) { }

static void on_midi(const uint8_t *msg, int len, int source) { }

static void set_param(const char *key, const char *val) { }

static int get_param(const char *key, char *buf, int buf_len) {
    return -1;
}

static void render_block(int16_t *out_lr, int frames) { }

static plugin_api_v1_t api = {
    .api_version = 1,
    .on_load = on_load,
    .on_unload = on_unload,
    .on_midi = on_midi,
    .set_param = set_param,
    .get_param = get_param,
    .render_block = render_block,
};

const plugin_api_v1_t* move_plugin_init_v1(const host_api_v1_t* host) {
    return &api;
}
```

### Building DSP Plugins

Add to `scripts/build.sh`:

```bash
"${CROSS_PREFIX}gcc" -g -O3 -shared -fPIC \
    src/modules/your-module/dsp/your_plugin.c \
    -o build/modules/your-module/dsp.so \
    -Isrc -Isrc/modules/your-module/dsp \
    -lm
```

## JS ↔ DSP Communication

Use `host_module_set_param()` and `host_module_get_param()` in your UI:

```javascript
// In ui.js
host_module_set_param("preset", "5");
let current = host_module_get_param("preset");
```

The DSP plugin receives these in `set_param()` and `get_param()`.

## Shadow UI Parameter Hierarchy

Modules expose a navigable parameter hierarchy to the Shadow UI via `ui_hierarchy` in module.json or `get_param("ui_hierarchy")`. The hierarchy uses a **levels dictionary** format with named levels:

```json
{
  "ui_hierarchy": {
    "levels": {
      "root": {
        "name": "My Synth",
        "params": [
          {"key": "cutoff", "name": "Cutoff", "type": "int", "min": 0, "max": 127},
          {"key": "mode", "name": "Mode", "type": "enum", "options": ["LP", "HP", "BP"]},
          {"level": "advanced", "label": "Advanced Settings"}
        ],
        "knobs": ["cutoff", "mode"]
      },
      "advanced": {
        "name": "Advanced",
        "params": [
          {"key": "drive", "name": "Drive", "type": "float", "min": 0, "max": 1}
        ],
        "knobs": ["drive"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Level Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` / `label` | Display name for the level |
| `params` | Array of parameter items (see below) |
| `knobs` | Array of parameter keys mapped to physical knobs 1-8 |
| `list_param` / `count_param` / `name_param` | For preset browser levels |
| `items_param` / `select_param` | For dynamic item selection levels |
| `child_prefix` / `child_count` / `child_label` | For repeated elements (see below) |
| `navigate_to` | Where to land after choosing from this level's list (see below) |
| `visible_if` | Optional conditional visibility rule for this level |
| `menu` | Array of `{label, action?, level?, value?}` rendered as a plain list page (see below) |

#### `menu` — a level's own action list, and where it lands

A level can declare its own list of actions/jumps that have no value to turn:

```json
"menu": [
  { "label": "Save", "action": "save" },
  { "label": "LFO 1", "level": "lfo1" },
  { "label": "Mode", "action": "mode", "value": "Poly" }
]
```

`value` is optional and right-aligned, so a settings-style menu reads like a
list. **It lands right after THAT LEVEL's own grid pages — not at the end of
the whole plan.** A `menu` on `root` is the SECOND page a user sees, not the
last, because the tree walk emits it before descending into any level `root`
navigates to. If you want your menu to read as a true finale, put it on its
own level and reference that level last — that is how Slot Settings does it,
and it only works there because that screen synthesises its entire hierarchy
end to end. A module author does not own the order the rest of the walk
takes, so there is no way to make an ordinary level's `menu` "last" from
inside `ui_hierarchy` itself.

**You never need this to get User Presets / Module actions.** Every loaded
chain component already gets a "My Presets" and a "Module" page appended
after its whole jog sequence, for free — declare nothing. See CLAUDE.md,
"Every component's knob grid ends with two pages it never declared", for why
that append happens in the planner rather than through this field.

#### Selector keys must not appear in `knobs`

The keys named by `list_param`, `count_param`, `name_param`, `items_param` and
`select_param` get their own page — a preset browser or an items list — which is
a better control than a knob and is where the host expects you to choose from.
**Listing one in `knobs` as well is now ignored.**

Two modules did it (`impressive-chords` `preset_index`, `breakbeat` `preset`) and
in both the `knobs` array was byte-identical to `params` — everything listed
rather than eight chosen — so the selector happened to land on knob 1. It could
not have worked anyway: `impressive-chords` declares `preset_index` as
`int 0..500` against 52 presets, so ~90% of that knob was dead travel landing on
nothing.

You lose nothing by leaving it out. Reported from the device as *"why is preset a
knob on impressive chords?"*.

#### `navigate_to` — where choosing leaves you

A level with `items_param` may declare `navigate_to: "<level>"`, meaning *"having
chosen from this list, the user wants to be there"*. Without it, choosing lands
on the first grid page.

Two behaviours worth knowing, both of which changed in 2026-08:

- **If the named level plans BOTH a preset browser and a knob grid, you get the
  browser.** `obxd` declares `banks -> navigate_to: "root"`, and its `root`
  carries `list_param`/`count_param` *and* `knobs`. Naming the level never said
  which, and the lookup used to filter to knob pages only — so choosing a bank
  landed on the sliders instead of in that bank's presets. A chooser that filters
  a list means "now show me the list".
- **You arrive with the page already open.** The jog is normally inert on a
  preset browser or items list until you click in (so that *paging past* one
  cannot audition every preset it goes by). A page you were **sent** to opens:
  you did not page there, you chose your way there, and one deliberate gesture
  should not need a second to take effect. Naming a level that plans no preset
  page still lands on its grid, as before.

There is deliberately no `navigate_to: {level, kind}` form. Only three modules in
the fleet declare `navigate_to` at all, and new vocabulary nobody adopts is how
`options_as_string` sat documented and unused for months.

### Parameter Item Types

Each entry in `params` is either:

- **Editable param**: `{"key": "cutoff", "name": "Cutoff", "type": "int", "min": 0, "max": 127}`
- **Navigation link**: `{"level": "advanced", "label": "Advanced Settings"}`

**Important:** Use `key` (not `param`) for editable parameter objects. Metadata (type, min, max) can come from either the hierarchy or `chain_params`.

### Naming a parameter: the knob grid has ~5 characters

A `name` (or a hierarchy item's `label`) is drawn into a 32px-wide cell on the
knob grid, and the label band budgets **the width of five `M`s**, which is
about 5-7 characters depending on the letters. Everything longer is squeezed,
and knowing how it is squeezed is the difference between a readable page and a
row of stumps.

Three passes, in order:

1. **Per-word mnemonics.** A shared table maps common audio vocabulary to a
   fixed short form — `attack`→`ATK`, `envelope`→`ENV`, `resonance`→`RES`,
   `rotation`→`ROT`, `polyphony`→`POLY`. Applied word by word, so "Filter
   Envelope" becomes `FLT ENV`.
2. **Squeeze.** Whatever is left is fitted to the cell: initials for the
   leading words, the last word kept longest, trailing indices preserved
   ("Osc 1 Octave" keeps its 1).
3. **Truncate**, if it still does not fit.

**The failure mode worth designing against is step 2 on an unknown word: it
drops vowels.** A word the table does not know becomes a non-word rather than
an abbreviation — `Rotation` used to draw `ROTATN`, `Wave Group` drew `WGROU`,
`Polyphony` drew `PLYPHN`. That is worse than truncation, and it is not fixed
by a wider cell.

So:

- **Prefer a short `name`.** "Fdbk Src" beats "Feedback Source"; you know the
  abbreviation you want, and the renderer is guessing.
- **Check what it actually draws** rather than counting characters — the
  budget is in pixels, so `I` and `M` are not the same:

  ```bash
  node -e 'import("./src/shared/param_pages/render_page_movy.mjs")
    .then(R => console.log(R.labelForCell("Your Param Name")))'
  ```

  Or see the whole page: `node tools/param-pages/preview_knob_card.mjs <module-id>`.
- **If a common word is missing from the table, add it there** rather than
  pre-abbreviating in your module — an entry fixes that word for every module
  that uses it. The table is `WORD_ABBREV` in
  `src/shared/param_pages/render_page_movy.mjs`, with the rules and a test in
  `tests/host/test_label_abbrev.sh`. Do not add a word that already fits: a
  mnemonic is a consolation for not fitting, never an improvement on the real
  word.

**Enum `options` are tighter still.** An enum value is drawn in a ~16px square,
roughly 3-4 characters, so long option strings are heavily cut. `["In", "Out"]`
survives where `["Input Env", "Output Env"]` does not — and the parameter's own
name is already carrying the context, so the option only has to disambiguate.

### Parameter Types

| Type | Fields | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `int` | `min`, `max` | Integer value with knob control |
| `float` | `min`, `max`, `step` | Float value (0.0-1.0 typical) |
| `enum` | `options` | List of string options |
| `filepath` | `root`, `start_path`, `filter` | Opens Shadow UI file browser and stores selected path |
| `module_picker` | `allow_none`, `allow_self`, `allowed_targets`, `param_key` | Dynamic enum from loaded chain components |
| `parameter_picker` | `target_key`, `numeric_only`, `allow_none` | Dynamic enum from selected target's exposed params |
| `mode` | `options` | Mode selector (like enum, triggers mode switch) |
| `note` | `mode`, `min_note`, `max_note` | Generated note selector (`single` uses note names only, `multi` includes octaves) |
| `rate` | `include_bars`, `bars_mode`, `include_triplets` | Generated musical rate list (divisions, triplets, bars) |
| `wav_position` | `display_unit`, `mode`, `filepath_param`, `min`, `max`, `step`, `shift_increment_multiplier` | Numeric position/trim param with waveform preview and marker |
| `string` | none (or `default`/`value`) | Opens on-screen text entry keyboard on edit |
| `canvas` | `display_value_type`, `canvas_script`, `canvas_overlay`, `show_footer`, `show_value` | Opens fullscreen module-defined canvas UI when clicked |

`rate.bars_mode` values:
- `bars-every` (default): every bar count from `16` down to `1`
- `bars-simple`: `16, 8, 4, 2, 1`
- Legacy aliases are still accepted: `pow2` -> `bars-simple`, `all` -> `bars-every`

Rate options are emitted from slowest to fastest timing, for example:
`16 bars, ... 2 bars, 1 bar, 1/1T, 1/2, 1/2T, 1/4, ...`

`wav_position` and `canvas` behavior details are documented in dedicated subsections below:
- `wav_position` in module.json
- `canvas` in module.json

`visible_if` can be attached to level entries and param entries:

```json
{
  "param": "sync",
  "equals": true
}
```

Supported condition fields:
- `equals`, `not_equals`
- `gt`/`greater_than`/`greater`
- `lt`/`smaller_than`/`smaller`
- `truthy`, `falsey`/`falsy`

Visibility is evaluated dynamically; hidden entries are removed from list navigation and knob mappings for that level.

### Parameter visualisations (`viz`)

A knob page can draw a parameter *group* as a picture instead of separate
controls — an ADSR as an envelope, cutoff+resonance as a filter response, three
band gains as an EQ curve. Declare the grouping and the UI draws it; leave it out
and the UI falls back to detecting the group from names and ranges, which works
but is a guess.

**Declare it.** Detection exists so that modules which say nothing still get
graphics; it is a fallback, not the contract. A declaration is also the only way
to correct a detector that guesses wrong.

Add an optional `viz` object to a `chain_params` entry:

```json
{ "key": "attack",  "name": "Attack",  "type": "float", "viz": { "group": "amp", "role": "attack"  } },
{ "key": "decay",   "name": "Decay",   "type": "float", "viz": { "group": "amp", "role": "decay"   } },
{ "key": "sustain", "name": "Sustain", "type": "float", "viz": { "group": "amp", "role": "sustain" } },
{ "key": "release", "name": "Release", "type": "float", "viz": { "group": "amp", "role": "release" } }
```

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `group` | An id shared by every param in one graphic. Any string; scoped to the module. Omit for single-param graphics. |
| `role` | This param's part in the group. Required when `group` is set. |
| `kind` | The graphic type. Optional — derived from the roles present when omitted. |
| `viz: false` | Never draw a graphic for this param, whatever a detector thinks. |

Kinds and their roles:

| `kind` | Roles | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| `envelope` | `attack`, `decay`, `sustain`, `release` | Any 2–4 of them: AD, AR, ASR and ADSR all draw. |
| `filter` | `cutoff`, `resonance`, optional `mode`, `slope` | `mode` should be an enum naming LP/HP/BP/notch. |
| `eq` | `low`, `mid`, `high` | Band **gains**, not crossover frequencies. |
| `lfo` | `shape`, `rate`, `depth`, optional `phase` | `shape` should be an enum of waveform names. |
| `waveform` | *(single param)* | An enum of waveform names, drawn as silhouettes. |
| `fader` | *(single param)* | A level/volume, drawn as a fader rather than a dial. |
| `switch` | *(single param)* | A `toggle` or **boolean-flavoured** two-option enum, drawn as an on/off switch. See the note below — not every two-option enum qualifies, and it changes the behaviour as well as the picture. |
| `sample` | *(single param)* + optional `position` | A `filepath`; a companion `wav_position` param marks playback position on the waveform. |

**A `switch` is not just a picture — it suppresses the option list.** Turning an
enum knob normally flashes its options up over the grid for ~700ms. A switch
does not, because it already draws both of its states: the track is one and its
inversion is the other, so a list of `Off`/`On` says what the cell says.

That makes the Off/On wording load-bearing. A two-option enum whose values are a
straight **choice** rather than a boolean — `Mix`/`Reverb`, `Saw`/`Square`,
`Legato`/`Trig`, `Time`/`Rate` — is deliberately *not* detected as a switch: it
draws as an enum square showing one word, and the other word is exactly what the
list is for. 134 cells across the fleet are in that group against 212 real
switches, so this is a live distinction, not an edge case.

Practical upshot: if your parameter genuinely means on/off, name the options so
it reads that way and it will get the switch and lose the list. If it is a
choice between two named things, leave it as a plain enum.

Two more rules worth knowing:

- **A group's params must land contiguously on one row.** This is a hard gate,
  not a style preference: a page is two rows of four, and a graphic can span
  neither the gap between them nor a hole in the middle of a run. A group whose
  roles straddle the row boundary — or sit on different pages — is not drawn at
  all, and its members fall back to plain controls. Since knob order comes from
  `ui_hierarchy`, declaring a group can force you to reorder that level's knobs
  so the roles sit together. `validate.mjs` reports the failure as
  `viz-declared-not-adjacent`.
- **A group is only as good as its roles.** Do not group unrelated params to get
  a picture — an envelope drawn over four params that are not an envelope is
  worse than four honest knobs.

#### What happens when you declare nothing

Resolution order is: the module's own `chain_params` `viz` → a host override →
the detectors → nothing. A module always outranks the host, and both outrank a
detector.

The detectors run in risk order — envelope, filter, LFO, waveform, fader,
switch, EQ, sample — and each key the earlier ones claim is off the table for
the rest. None of them fire on a name alone; every one corroborates against
declared metadata. An envelope needs 2–4 numeric roles that share a key stem
(`f_attack`/`f_decay` group; `amp_attack`/`filter_decay` do not), a filter needs
both cutoff and resonance, a fader rejects a bipolar range as a pan or trim
rather than a level, and an EQ band gain must be bipolar and roughly symmetric.
All of them still require the contiguous-row run above.

A param no detector claims gets an ordinary knob dial — the same cell it would
have had before graphics existed. That is the default, and for most params it is
the right one: leaving something undeclared is a real choice, not a gap to fill.
Prefer it over inventing a group, and use `viz: false` when a detector keeps
claiming something it should not.

One page-wide exception: a graphic needs a row at least 14 px tall and a cell at
least 26 px wide. A page that cannot give it that drops to plain dials
*entirely*, rather than clipping pictures or mixing them with dials.

Check what a module declares, and what is being guessed on its behalf, with:

```bash
node tools/param-pages/validate.mjs <module-id>
```

`viz-inferred` findings are the detector reporting a guess it made — each one is
a group you could confirm or correct by declaring it.

### Child Selectors (for repeated elements)

For synths with multiple similar elements (tones, operators, parts), use child selectors:

```json
{
  "levels": {
    "tones": {
      "name": "Tones",
      "child_prefix": "nvram_tone_",
      "child_count": 4,
      "child_label": "Tone",
      "params": [
        {"key": "cutofffrequency", "name": "Cutoff"},
        {"key": "resonance", "name": "Resonance"},
        {"key": "level", "name": "Level"}
      ],
      "knobs": ["cutofffrequency", "resonance", "level"]
    }
  }
}
```

The Shadow UI will show a selector (Tone 1, Tone 2, etc.) and prefix parameter keys with `child_prefix` + index (e.g., `synth:nvram_tone_0_cutofffrequency`).

#### Custom key shapes

`child_prefix` assumes keys look like `<prefix><index>_<key>`, zero-based and
unpadded. Many modules — drum modules especially — use a different shape, and
without a way to declare it they end up listing an *alias* (`pad_vol`, meaning
"the focused pad") and leaving the concrete keys (`p01_vol` … `p16_vol`)
declared in `chain_params` but listed in no level. Those params are then
unreachable from any UI: fleet-wide that is the single largest source of
unreachable parameters.

These optional fields declare the real shape instead:

| Field | Purpose | Default |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `child_key_template` | Key pattern, with `{index}` and `{key}` placeholders | `<child_prefix>{index}_{key}` |
| `child_index_base` | First instance number — pads are usually 1..16 | `0` |
| `child_index_digits` | Zero-pad the index to this width (`p01_` not `p1_`) | none |
| `child_key_overrides` | Per-key template overrides, for the odd key that breaks the pattern | none |
| `child_index_param` | A param through which **your module** owns which instance is focused | none (UI-local) |

```json
"pad_settings": {
  "name": "Pad",
  "child_count": 16,
  "child_label": "Pad",
  "child_key_template": "p{index}_{key}",
  "child_index_base": 1,
  "child_index_digits": 2,
  "child_key_overrides": { "fx1": "v{index}_{key}" },
  "knobs": ["vol", "pan", "tune", "decay"]
}
```

That level declares four params and the host multiplies them into 64 real keys
(`p01_vol` … `p16_decay`), each one addressable, automatable and reachable from
the UI — with no per-module configuration file anywhere.

`child_prefix` continues to mean exactly what it always did, so existing
declarations are unaffected.

#### `child_index_param` — when the MODULE owns the focus

By default the focused instance is UI state, changed only by picking from the
instance list. That is right for a synth, where "Part 2" is a deliberate
navigation choice, and wrong for a drum module, where **hitting a pad** is how
you choose what you are editing.

Declare `child_index_param` and the param becomes the single source of truth in
both directions: the UI reads it and follows, and picking from the list writes
it. So a module that moves the focus itself and a user who picks from the list
can never disagree — they are the same write.

```json
"pad_settings": {
  "child_count": 16, "child_label": "Pad",
  "child_key_template": "p{index}_{key}",
  "child_index_base": 1, "child_index_digits": 2,
  "child_index_param": "focused_pad",
  "knobs": ["vol", "pan", "tune", "start"]
}
```

The value is the instance number **in your own numbering** — with
`child_index_base: 1`, pad 1 is `"1"`. Serve it from `get_param` and accept it
in `set_param`.

Two things the host guarantees, which you can rely on:

- **A read that does not answer never moves the focus.** An empty, non-numeric
  or out-of-range value is ignored rather than treated as instance 0 — moving
  the user off the pad they were editing because a read timed out would re-key
  every page on screen.
- **It costs no extra IPC.** The read shares a rotation stop with the preset
  name, and a level that does not declare it reads nothing at all.

Without this, adding a child level to a module that already follows the played
pad would *cost* that behaviour — the grid would sit on the instance the picker
last chose. With it, the declaration is purely additive.

#### Copying and clearing an instance — hold Copy or Delete, then pick

A drum rack's oldest gesture: hold **Copy**, hit a pad, hit another, and the
second now sounds like the first. The knob grid offers it to any child level,
once the module has claimed the buttons (`capabilities.claims_edit_ccs`; Move
keeps them otherwise):

- **Hold Copy** on an instance's page: that instance is the source. Every
  instance that becomes focused while Copy is held — a pad hit through
  `child_index_param`, or a pick from the instance list — is pasted into.
- **Hold Delete**: every instance that becomes focused is cleared.
- **Undo** puts back the last instance overwritten (one level).

What is copied is the level's **`child_copy_keys`**, in declared order (that
is also the write order, so list the sample first), or the level's own params
when none are declared. Declare the list: "what the page shows" is a weak
default. A pad's level-affecting params with no cell — a gain, a velocity
depth — would be skipped and the copy would be quieter than its source, and
a key that is a *pointer* (a position within this pad's folder, an identity
like its note) must not be copied at all.

```json
"pads": {
  "child_prefix": "pad", "child_count": 32,
  "child_index_param": "ui_current_pad",
  "child_copy_keys": ["sample", "start", "end", "transpose", "gain", "volume", "pan"],
  "knobs": ["start", "end", "transpose", "volume", "pan"]
}
```

Clear writes each key's declared `default`; a key without one is left alone,
and a filepath without one is written `""`. A key whose read does not complete
cancels the whole operation — a copy missing one key would leave the target's
own value in place and still report a paste — so declare keys the module
actually serves. The focused instance itself is
not touched by Delete going down — only the instances you pick while holding
it — so a pad already on screen is cleared by picking another first.

### Declaring your performance surface

A sequencer driving your module — movy is the live case — has to lay out Move's
pads before it can draw anything, and until now it could not ask you: a drum
module wants a rack where one pad is one voice and hitting a pad is how you pick
what to edit, a synth wants a chromatic keyboard, and nothing in `module.json`
or `ui_hierarchy` said which. So it kept a private table instead — a
`movy_config.json` per module, 14 bundled configs and a four-module override
list — in which `padScoping.concreteKeyTemplate` is a verbatim re-spelling of
`child_key_template`. Two optional declarations at the top of `ui_hierarchy`
replace that table for every consumer at once.

#### `pad_layout` — say it, because nobody can work it out

```json
{ "pad_layout": "drums", "levels": { } }
```

`"drums"` or `"chromatic"`. **Absent is a distinct third state meaning you have
not said** — which is where all 100 captured fleet modules sit today. Absent is
not a synonym for chromatic: a consumer picks its own default and is never told
you are melodic when you have not said, so a sequencer can keep a bundled
fallback for an undeclared module without that fallback ever overriding a real
declaration. An unrecognised string is also unspecified, not a licence to
guess. Same tri-state discipline the param channel already enforces between
`null` and `""`.

**The layout is never inferred from the presence of notes, and you must not
rely on it being.** Declaring notes is not declaring a layout. A sampler with
key zones, a multitimbral synth and a chord module all legitimately carry notes
on melodic per-zone pages, and a consumer that read "has notes" as "is a drum
rack" would seat every one of them as one. Notes describe *voices*; `pad_layout`
describes the *surface*; the two axes never imply each other. `"drums"` with no
voices declared is legal (a rack whose pages are not published yet), and
`"chromatic"` with a note on every zone page is legal and correct.

It lives in `ui_hierarchy` rather than in `module.json` capabilities so that a
module whose answer depends on what is loaded — an sfz player, a slicer: drums
or melodic according to the kit — can serve it from `get_param` and change it.
**Where you put it depends on your `component_type`, and for a sound generator
there is only one choice.** The chain host calls `parse_ui_hierarchy_cache` for
audio FX and MIDI FX only (`chain_host.c:337`, `:705`, `chain_midi.c:317`), so
those two may declare a fixed hierarchy in `module.json` and never implement
`get_param("ui_hierarchy")`. **A sound generator's `module.json` hierarchy is
never read** — `synth:ui_hierarchy` goes straight to the plugin
(`chain_host.c:1755`), with no fallback. If you are writing a synth, serve it
from `get_param` or it does not exist.

This is easy to get wrong because the declaration looks identical either way,
and a synth that declares one in `module.json` gets no error — it is simply
ignored, and the grid plans from `chain_params` as though you had declared
nothing.

#### Voices: a level that declares `note` is a voice; one that does not is a page

**The sibling shape** — one level per voice, each differently shaped, the way
9W9 / 6W6 / 8W8 / CW78 are built. `reverb` declares no note, so it is a page,
not a voice: it is navigable and it sounds nothing. That distinction is the
whole point. Those four modules are on movy's override list precisely because
their private configs put a pad on every bank *including* the ones with no
voice behind them, and "every bank is a voice" collapses the module to a single
page.

```json
{
  "pad_layout": "drums",
  "focus_param": "ui_voice",
  "levels": {
    "root": { "params": [
      { "level": "bass_drum", "label": "Bass Drum" },
      { "level": "snare",     "label": "Snare" },
      { "level": "reverb",    "label": "Reverb" }
    ] },
    "bass_drum": { "name": "Bass Drum", "note": 36, "role": "kick",  "knobs": ["tune", "decay"] },
    "snare":     { "name": "Snare",     "note": 38, "role": "snare", "knobs": ["tune", "snap"] },
    "reverb":    { "name": "Reverb", "knobs": ["size", "mix"] }
  }
}
```

Two voices — `bass_drum` (index 0) then `snare` (index 1), in `root`'s nav-link
order, which is the order the user sees and the order a rack is seated in. A
voice level `root` does not link is **appended** after the linked ones in
`levels` declaration order rather than dropped: a voice reachable only from a
sub-level still needs a stable index, and dropping it would make two consumers
disagree about the same list while both looked correct.

**The template shape** — interchangeable instances behind one key template, the
way mrdrums and po32-drum are built. The note map hangs off the same child
level you already declare:

```json
{
  "pad_layout": "drums",
  "levels": {
    "root": { "params": [{ "level": "pads", "label": "Pads" }] },
    "pads": {
      "child_count": 4,
      "child_label": "Pad",
      "child_key_template": "p{index}_{key}",
      "child_index_base": 1,
      "child_index_digits": 2,
      "child_index_param": "ui_current_pad",
      "child_notes": [36, 38, 42, 46],
      "child_names": ["Kick", "Snare", "Closed Hat"],
      "child_roles": ["kick", "snare", "hat", "hat"],
      "knobs": ["vol", "pan", "tune", "decay"]
    }
  }
}
```

Four voices: `Kick`/36, `Snare`/38, `Closed Hat`/42, and `Pad 4`/46 — the
fourth name falls back **per item** to the generated `child_label` + index, so
naming your first three pads is an improvement rather than a trade. The
generated number honours `child_index_base` (hence "Pad 4" for the fourth
instance under `child_index_base: 1`) while `child_names` and `child_notes` are
indexed from **0**, in declaration order, always.

**Your rack may be `root` itself.** Nothing requires a child level to sit
behind a nav link from `root` — mrdrums declares its 16 pads *on* `root`, and
that is the fleet's flagship template-shape drum module:

```json
{
  "pad_layout": "drums",
  "levels": {
    "root": {
      "name": "Pads",
      "child_count": 16,
      "child_label": "Pad",
      "child_key_template": "p{index}_{key}",
      "child_index_base": 1,
      "child_index_digits": 2,
      "child_index_param": "ui_current_pad",
      "child_note_base": 36,
      "knobs": ["vol", "pan", "tune", "decay"]
    }
  }
}
```

Sixteen voices, `Pad 1`/36 … `Pad 16`/51. `child_note_base` is the contiguous
form: instance *i* in declaration order plays `base + i`. Use `child_notes`
when the map is sparse; it wins over `child_note_base` wherever both are
declared.

#### The fields

| Field | Where | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `pad_layout` | hierarchy top level | `drums` \| `chromatic`; absent = unspecified, and unspecified is not chromatic |
| `note` | a level | the MIDI note this level's voice plays; a level with none is a page |
| `role` | a level | free-form hint (`kick`, `hat`); **no host behaviour depends on it** |
| `child_note_base` | a child level | instance *i* plays `base + i` |
| `child_notes` | a child level | sparse per-instance notes; wins over `child_note_base` |
| `child_names` | a child level | per-instance names; falls back **per item** to `child_label` + index |
| `child_roles` | a child level | per-instance roles, same free-form rule as `role` |

#### A `note` is a MIDI NOTE, never a pad id

Move's own surface reports **pad identifiers** on cable 0 — pad 1 is 68 — and
those are not what you declare. A chain slot never sees them: it is fed the
TRACK's output, so what reaches your `on_midi` is the note the track plays
(36 for a drum track's first pad, a scale note for a melodic one). Declaring
the pad id instead makes a voice that can never match anything the module
receives, and the symptom is silent — the pads simply do nothing, with no error
anywhere.

The distinction is easy to lose because an **overtake** tool does see cable 0:
it owns the surface. That is exactly why the note belongs on this side. You say
"this voice plays note 38", and the consumer decides which pad to put it on —
movy seats its own grid, a sequencer seats its own, and an external keyboard
needs no seating at all. Declaring pad ids would invert that and bake one
controller's geometry into every module that ever declares a voice.

`synth:last_note` is the same fact from the host side: it records what the
SYNTH received, so it is directly comparable to a declared `note` and never to
a pad id. It is a diagnostic — **nothing navigates on it**, for the reason
under "Why there is no note-based fallback" below.

| `focus_param` | hierarchy top level | a param naming the focused voice: a **level name**, optionally prefixed `"<count>:"` |

`role` is a **free string** and deliberately not an enumeration. It is a hint a
consumer may use to colour or seat a rack it has never seen, and one that does
not recognise a value ignores it. Constraining it would mean maintaining a
percussion vocabulary inside the host for a field the host never reads.

**Size.** `chain_params` over 64KB will not load, and `ui_hierarchy` shares
that budget. Sixteen `child_names` is nothing; 200 of them plus 200
`child_roles` is worth counting before you ship.

#### Which voice is focused — one live input, and you choose it

A consumer showing a per-voice page needs to know which voice is focused, and
to keep in step when *you* move that focus (a pad press, a preset load, an
auto-select). **YOU own that fact. Nothing infers it from what is played.**

| You declare | Input read | Resolved by |
|---|---|---|
| `child_index_param` (template shape) | `<prefix>:<child_index_param>` — your own instance numbering | instance → voice index |
| `focus_param` (sibling shape) | `<prefix>:<focus_param>` — a **level name** | level name → voice index |
| neither | nothing is read | the grid does not follow |

**Declaring neither is a valid choice**, not a gap: your voices are still
declared, so a sequencer can lay out pads and the header minimap still works —
the grid simply does not move on its own.

##### Why there is no note-based fallback

There used to be a third row here: the host would follow `synth:last_note`, the
note it last saw reach your synth. It is gone, and the reason is worth stating
because it is not obvious. **A SEQUENCER PLAYS NOTES.** With a pattern running,
every hit is a note, so the page changed on every drum in the bar — the editor
was unusable exactly while you listened to the thing you were editing. "The pad
you HIT" is a gesture; "the note that SOUNDED" is a different fact and cannot
stand in for it.

Nor can the two be separated where it mattered: a pad press and a clip both
reach your synth through Move's MIDI_OUT echo, tagged identically. Cable 0 does
carry real presses — the shim routes them to the focused slot — but only for a
module declaring capture rules, and a module able to do that is equally able to
publish a focus param.

`synth:last_note` is still served (see `docs/CHAIN.md`) and is a reasonable
thing for a sequencer to ask. **Nothing navigates on it.**

##### A focus answer may carry a CHANGE TOKEN

Your focus param may answer either form:

```
snare        the level, and nothing else
17:snare     a monotonic hit COUNT, then the level
```

**Prefer the second.** The grid acts on a CHANGE, not on a value — otherwise it
would drag you back to the focused voice on every rotation stop and you could
never navigate away. But that means a repeat of the same answer does nothing,
and a repeat is exactly what a second hit on the pad you are already editing
looks like. Hit the kick, browse to Reverb, hit the kick again: with a bare
name you stay on Reverb, because the answer never changed. The count is the
only thing that records the *event*.

9W9 has published `"<count>:<level>"` from `ui_focus_level` since before this
contract existed, for exactly this reason. Both forms are accepted; a bare name
behaves as it always has.

The two guarantees carried over from `child_index_param` hold for all three
inputs. **A read that does not answer never moves the focus** — empty,
non-numeric, an unknown level name or an out-of-range index is ignored rather
than treated as voice 0. And **it costs no extra IPC**: the read rides a
rotation stop the grid already takes.

### Example: Chord MIDI FX Hierarchy

```json
{
  "levels": {
    "root": {
      "name": "Chord",
      "params": [
        {"key": "type", "name": "Type", "type": "enum",
         "options": ["none", "major", "minor", "dim", "aug", "sus2", "sus4", "power", "octave"]},
        {"key": "inversion", "name": "Inversion", "type": "enum",
         "options": ["root", "1st", "2nd", "3rd"]},
        {"key": "strum", "name": "Strum", "type": "int", "min": 0, "max": 100}
      ],
      "knobs": ["type", "inversion", "strum"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Chain Parameters (Knob Mappings)

Modules can expose quick-access knob mappings via `chain_params`. This can be defined statically in `module.json` or dynamically via `get_param("chain_params")`.

### Static Definition (module.json)

For modules with fixed parameters, define in capabilities:

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "chain_params": [
      {
        "key": "cutoff",
        "name": "Cutoff",
        "type": "int",
        "min": 0,
        "max": 127,
        "default": 64
      },
      {
        "key": "type",
        "name": "Filter Type",
        "type": "enum",
        "options": ["lowpass", "highpass", "bandpass"],
        "default": "lowpass"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Dynamic Definition (get_param)

For modules with state-dependent parameters:

```c
int get_param(void *instance, const char *key, char *buf, int buf_len) {
    if (strcmp(key, "chain_params") == 0) {
        const char *json = "["
            "{\"key\": \"cutoff\", \"name\": \"Cutoff\", \"type\": \"int\", \"min\": 0, \"max\": 127, \"value\": 64},"
            "{\"key\": \"resonance\", \"name\": \"Resonance\", \"type\": \"int\", \"min\": 0, \"max\": 127, \"value\": 32}"
        "]";
        strncpy(buf, json, buf_len);
        return strlen(json);
    }
    return -1;
}
```

#### Pattern: a knob whose options depend on another selection

*"Select a folder, then turn a pot through the wavetables in it."* This works
today; nothing needs adding to the host. Reported as impossible by a module
author, so it is written down here.

**Why a `filepath` cannot do it.** `type: "filepath"` is **opaque**: the grid can
*open* it but never *turn* it, on purpose — turning would write nonsense into a
path. A knob asking to drive a filepath is asking for a control the host has
classified as un-turnable. That is usually the whole reason this looks impossible.

**The shape that works:**

1. Declare the dependent control as `type: "enum"` with an `options` array
   holding the current folder's entries. It becomes turnable *and* divable —
   hold the knob and click opens a scrolling picker, which is what you want past
   a handful of entries.
2. Serve `chain_params` from `get_param` (dynamic, above) rather than a static
   string, so the option list can change.
3. Offer the folder as its own level with `items_param` / `select_param`.

**The host re-reads your contract when the user chooses.** Committing an items
selection arms a settle deadline; once your answer stops changing, the host
re-reads `chain_params` / `ui_hierarchy` and re-plans the pages, so the knob
steps the new folder's list. It is throttled — the deadline re-arms per detent
and two agreeing readings are required — so spinning a folder list costs about
five contract reads in total, not one per step.

**The obligation: do not scan the filesystem to answer.** `get_param` and
`set_param` are the SPI audio callback (see the threading section). Scan on your
own `SCHED_OTHER` worker when the folder changes, publish the result by pointer
swap, and let `get_param` only *format* an already-cached list. A module that
scans a directory inside `get_param` pays that cost **once per repaint**.

**Limits to design against:**

| Limit | Value | What happens past it |
|---|---|---|
| `MAX_ENUM_OPTIONS` (`chain_internal.h`) | 128 | The knob grid still lists them (JS parses the JSON itself), but the chain host's C-side knob-mapping and modulation tables truncate — the picker works while CC mapping quietly does not |
| `chain_params` string | 64 KB (`SHADOW_PARAM_VALUE_LEN`) | The read fails; see the three-answers rule |

Keep a folder under 128 entries, or paginate it into sub-levels.

And the enum wire rule still applies: index in, index out — or names both ways
with `options_as_string: true`. A module that already resolves an index into its
scan list should report the index and declare nothing.

### Parameter Types

Use the canonical type list in `Shadow UI Parameter Hierarchy -> Parameter Types`.
For `chain_params`, the same types apply, and `default`/`value` can be used to provide initial values.

#### `filepath` in module.json

Use `type: "filepath"` in `capabilities.chain_params` to let Shadow UI open a reusable file browser.

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "chain_params": [
      {
        "key": "sample_file",
        "name": "Sample File",
        "type": "filepath",
        "root": "/data/UserData",
        "start_path": "/data/UserData/UserLibrary/Samples",
        "filter": ".wav",
        "default": ""
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

`filepath` fields:

- `key` (required): Parameter key passed to `set_param`.
- `name` (required): Label shown in Shadow UI.
- `type` (required): Must be `"filepath"`.
- `root` (optional, recommended): Absolute folder where browsing starts and is constrained.
- `start_path` (optional): Absolute folder or file path used as the initial location when current value is empty.
- `filter` (optional): File extension filter as a string or array, for example `".wav"` or `[".wav", ".aif"]`.
- `live_preview` (optional): When true, moving the file-browser cursor over files temporarily sets the parameter to that file until the user confirms or cancels.
- `browser_hooks` (optional): Event hooks to run additional parameter writes at browser lifecycle points. Supported keys: `on_open`, `on_preview`, `on_cancel`, `on_commit`.
- `default` or `value` (optional): Initial absolute path. If the path exists and is inside `root`, the browser opens to the parent folder and highlights the file.

Behavior notes:

- Selected files are stored as absolute paths.
- Initial browser location priority is: current/default value, then `start_path`, then `root`.
- If the chosen start location is missing, invalid, or outside `root`, the browser falls back to `root`.
- With `live_preview: true`, preview changes are temporary: Back cancels and restores the original value, Click commits the highlighted file.
- `browser_hooks` action format is `{ "key": "<param>", "value": "<string>", "restore": true|false }`. Non-prefixed keys are resolved against the active component prefix.
- `browser_hooks` supports value placeholders: `$path`/`$selected_path` and `$filename`/`$selected_filename`.
- For pad samplers, you can suspend auto-pad switching while browsing by adding `{"key":"ui_auto_select_pad","value":"off","restore":true}` to `browser_hooks.on_open`.
- Example user sample file path: `/data/UserData/UserLibrary/Samples/Drums/Kick01.wav`.

#### `wav_position` in module.json

Use `type: "wav_position"` for numeric position/trim controls with waveform visualization in edit mode.

`wav_position` fields:

- `key` (required): Parameter key passed to `set_param`.
- `name` (required): Label shown in Shadow UI.
- `type` (required): Must be `"wav_position"`.
- `display_unit` (optional): `percent`, `ms`, `sec`/`s` (default `percent`). In `percent` mode values are stored internally as normalized `0..1` and displayed as `0..100%`.
- `mode` (optional): `position`, `start`, `end` (legacy aliases: `trim_front`, `trim_end`).
- `filepath_param` (recommended): Key of the linked filepath parameter containing the WAV source.
- `min`, `max`, `step` (optional): Numeric range and increment for editing. Defaults: `percent` uses `0..1` with `step: 0.01`; `ms` uses `step: 1`; `sec` uses `step: 0.01`.
- `shift_increment_multiplier` (optional): Multiplier for Shift fine-step (default `0.1`; alias `shift_step_multiplier`).

Behavior notes:

- Waveform view opens only while the parameter is in edit mode.
- `mode: start` and `mode: end` use side-aware waveform rendering for trim workflows.
- On filepath selection commit, empty linked `mode: end` params are initialized to file end (`1.0` internal / `100%` displayed in percent mode, WAV duration for `ms`/`sec`).

#### `canvas` in module.json

Use `type: "canvas"` to open a module-defined fullscreen canvas UI from the hierarchy editor.

`canvas` fields:

- `key` (required): Parameter key passed to `set_param`.
- `name` (required): Label shown in Shadow UI.
- `type` (required): Must be `"canvas"`.
- `display_value_type` (optional): `string`, `int`, `float`, or `percent` formatting for value display.
- `canvas_script` (optional): Script path relative to module root (default `canvas.js`), supports `file.js#overlay_name`.
- `canvas_overlay` (optional): Named overlay object selector (aliases: `canvas_target`, `overlay`).
- `show_footer` (optional): Show/hide footer in canvas view (default `true`; alias `showfooter`).
- `show_value` (optional): Show/hide parameter value in hierarchy and canvas footer (default `true`; alias `showvalue`).

Behavior notes:

- Clicking the parameter enters a dedicated fullscreen canvas view.
- Set `show_value: false` for button-style canvas entries that should not show a value.
- The loaded script should expose `globalThis.canvas_overlay` (or `globalThis.canvas_overlays`) with hooks such as `onOpen`, `onMidi`, `tick`, `draw`, `onClose`, `onExit`.

#### Custom widgets (`drawCell`)

A canvas overlay can also draw **inside a knob cell**, not only fullscreen. Same
file, same hooks object, two scales: `drawCell` paints one knob box in the grid,
and `draw` paints the fullscreen view you dive into from that same cell.

Declare the kind in `chain_params`, on the existing `viz` field — `viz` is an
object, so the namespace goes on its `kind`:

```json
{ "key": "drive", "name": "Drive", "type": "float",
  "viz": { "kind": "custom:mymeter" } }
```

Grouped widgets work exactly as built-in ones do; the kind may sit on any member:

```json
{ "key": "x", "name": "X", "type": "float", "viz": { "group": "pad", "role": "x", "kind": "custom:xy" } },
{ "key": "y", "name": "Y", "type": "float", "viz": { "group": "pad", "role": "y" } }
```

Then export three things from your `canvas.js` overlay:

```javascript
globalThis.canvas_overlay = {
    widgetKind: "custom:mymeter",
    widgetNominal: { w: 17, h: 15 },   // optional; only sprites need it

    drawCell(ctx, { values, group, metaIndex, anim, nowMs, baseValues }) {
        const v = Number(values[group.keys[0]]) || 0;
        ctx.fillRect(0, 0, Math.round(ctx.width * v), ctx.height, 1);
    },

    draw(ctx) { /* the fullscreen view, as before */ },
};
```

##### Declaring more than one widget

A module may supply several widgets. `widgetKind` is the single-widget spelling
and is unchanged; `widgetKinds` is the plural, in either of two forms:

```javascript
globalThis.canvas_overlay = {
    /* several names, ONE drawer -- right when they are one drawing at two
     * crops, told apart by group.keys[0] */
    widgetKinds: ["custom:face", "custom:mouth"],
    drawCell(ctx, { values, group }) { /* branch on group.keys[0] */ },
};
```

```javascript
globalThis.canvas_overlay = {
    /* a drawer EACH -- right when the widgets are unrelated, and the only form
     * that lets each carry its own nominal */
    widgetKinds: {
        "custom:meter": (ctx, o) => { /* ... */ },
        "custom:mode":  { draw(ctx, o) { /* ... */ }, nominal: { w: 17, h: 15 } },
    },
};
```

Both forms may be combined with `widgetKind`. A kind that cannot be registered —
no drawer, or a name outside the `custom:` namespace — is **named in
`debug.log`** rather than dropped: a declared widget that never registers falls
through to a built-in, which looks completely correct, so the log line is the
only way to find out the picture is not yours.

##### A widget that needs a value with no cell on the page

A widget is handed the page's value map and cannot read. So a picture that
depends on a value with **no cell on this page** — the vowel of *which*
character, a ratio against *which* base — has to name it:

```json
{ "key": "vowel", "type": "float", "min": 0, "max": 1,
  "viz": { "kind": "custom:mouth", "extra_keys": ["face"] } }
```

The controller adds each to its value rotation as one extra stop and hands it
over in `values`, exactly like a key that does have a cell.

**One read per stop, so declare what the picture needs and nothing else.**
Capped at four: a cell asking for twenty would spend the page's whole read
budget and starve every other value on screen. An unavailable custom kind
contributes none, since its group is abandoned whole.

Without this the only way to get a fact to a widget was to give it a knob —
which is how a module ended up shipping a read-only cell that existed purely to
carry a number to the cell beside it.

##### A parameter the module drives itself

A knob is not always the only thing moving a parameter. A synth that sweeps its
own vowel from pad pressure, a step sequencer walking its own position — the
picture of that value should follow what it is *doing*, not where its knob was
left.

```json
{ "key": "vowel", "type": "float", "min": 0, "max": 1, "live": true }
```

`live` buys the treatment a chain-modulated key already gets: the module is
asked for `<key>:effective` **every tick**, rather than on the value rotation,
and graphics are handed base-merged-with-effective. The rotation comes round
about four times a second on an eight-knob page, and an animation drawn from
that is a slideshow — the per-tick refresh is the entire point.

Serve `<key>:effective` from your `get_param`, and `<key>:base` too if you want
to save the host a fallback read. `values` stays the BASE everywhere a value is
edited, because that is what a turn changes.

**A silent slot is barely rendered.** The shim skips `render_block` on a slot
making no sound — one probe frame in 172 — so an effective value computed inside
`render_block` will appear frozen until something plays. Compute it from state
your `set_param` already holds.

**What you can draw with.** The frame context carries `fillRect`, `print`,
`textWidth`, `setPixel`, `line`, `fillCircle`, `drawCircle` and `drawArc`. All of
them are always present — they are implemented on the frame's own clipped
`fillRect` rather than delegated to the host, so there is nothing to feature-detect
and nothing that can escape your frame. `drawArc(cx, cy, r, startDeg, sweepDeg,
color)` reads angles the way a knob does: **0 at twelve o'clock, increasing
clockwise**, so a track from 210 to 510 puts its gap at the bottom. The circle and
arc are pixel-identical to the host's, so yours sits beside a built-in arc knob
without looking like a different object.

They cost more bindings than the host's single call — a filled circle is one
`fillRect` per row — which is the price of clipping being structural. Fine at cell
and card sizes; reach for a rect if you are filling something large every frame.

**The frame is not the screen.** `(0,0)` is your knob box's top-left and
`ctx.width` / `ctx.height` are the box's, not the display's. There is no accessor
that reaches absolute coordinates, and anything you draw outside the frame is
clipped away. Size everything against `ctx.width`/`ctx.height`: the same widget
is handed at least sixteen different frame sizes across the two renderers,
because the grid's row height is dynamic and a group near the right edge is
clamped.

**You get values; you cannot read them.** `drawCell`'s ctx has no `getParam` —
values arrive in the `values` argument. A param read is ~2.8 ms against a
1.68 ms whole-page render, so one read costs more than redrawing the entire
screen. (The same restriction applies to a fullscreen `draw` and to `tick`.)

**The label is not yours.** Schwung keeps drawing every cell's label, so a page
mixing custom and built-in cells stays consistent.

**One strike.** If `drawCell` throws, that widget is disabled for the session,
the throw is logged, and the built-in widget draws in its place — the page stays
correct rather than showing a hole.

**An unknown kind degrades, it does not fail.** A host that has never heard of
your `custom:` name simply doesn't claim those keys, so the built-in draws. That
is what makes a module shipping custom widgets safe on an older Schwung.

##### Generating a widget from sprite art (no JavaScript)

If your widget is a lookup — a value picks one of N pictures — you don't have to
write the drawing code. Describe the frames and run the generator:

```json
{
  "kind": "custom:mymeter",
  "nominal": { "w": 17, "h": 15 },
  "frames": [
    { "atMost": 0.5, "rows": ["#####............", "..."] },
    { "atMost": 1.0, "rows": ["#################", "..."] }
  ]
}
```

```bash
node tools/param-pages/widget_gen.mjs widgets.json > widgets.mjs
```

`rows` is `#` for a set pixel and anything else for clear. **Every frame must
match `nominal` exactly** — 1-bit art is never rescaled (it dithers into mush),
so a mismatched frame cannot be corrected at runtime and the generator refuses
it on your machine instead. Output is run-length encoded because a page holds
eight knob boxes: per-pixel blitting would cost ~1 ms of the 1.68 ms page render.

##### The reference module

`src/modules/audio_fx/widget-test/` is a working example of **all three**
module-supplied surfaces: `canvas.js` supplies the `drawCell` segmented meter on
`level`, a SECOND widget kind on `mode` (through `widgetKinds`, to show that one
module may declare several), and the fullscreen `draw`; `cards.js` supplies the
card that floats while `level` turns — and that card reads `mode` out of
`o.values`, which is the worked example of a card whose meaning lives on another
parameter. A passthrough DSP makes it a real, loadable chain FX.

Its card is also the reference for the null contract: `raw` may be null, and the
drawer prints `--` with **no bar** rather than a bar at zero, because a bar at
zero is indistinguishable from a genuine zero.

**It does not ship.** Like `gesture-test` and `sysex-test` it is a hardware
fixture, built and packaged only on request:

```bash
SCHWUNG_BUILD_TEST_MODULES=1 ./scripts/build.sh
./scripts/install.sh local --skip-modules --skip-confirmation
```

Then add **Widget Test** as an audio FX and look at the Level knob.

Note that the gate covers both halves. Compiling the `.so` conditionally is not
enough on its own — `build.sh`'s generic copy step collects every `module.json`
under `src/modules/`, so a fixture also has to be scrubbed from `build/` when
the gate is off. A `module.json` shipped without its `.so` still appears in the
FX picker, and a chain slot pointing at a module that cannot load is restored on
every boot. `tests/host/test_test_fixtures_not_shipped.sh` pins both halves.

#### Custom UI pages (`as_page`)

A `type: "canvas"` param is a CELL you click to dive into a fullscreen view.
Add `as_page` and it becomes a **page in the level's jog rotation** instead,
carrying that level's own knobs:

```json
{ "key": "face", "name": "Face", "type": "canvas",
  "canvas_script": "canvas.js", "as_page": true, "show_value": false }
```

```javascript
globalThis.canvas_overlay = {
    drawPage(ctx, { values, base, keys, touched, nowMs, preset }) {
        /* ctx is frame-scoped to the BODY BAND. (0,0) is its top-left. */
    },
};
```

- **It is reached by paging, not by diving**, and the canvas key gets no cell of
  its own — so it does not also appear as an orphan overflow page.
- **The eight encoders work**, doing exactly what they do on that level's grid.
  You write no input code: the page carries the same keys.
- **It animates.** The host redraws every tick and the page's keys are already
  in the read rotation, so `values` is fresh at no extra cost. `nowMs` is a wall
  clock for anything driven by time.
- **The chrome is the host's.** You are handed the band the eight cells would
  have occupied — the header (including the touch strip while a knob is held),
  the bank bar and the footer are drawn around you. You cannot paint over them
  and you should not draw any of your own.
- `values` carries live values merged over the base; `base` is the knob
  positions, for a page that wants to show both.
- **One strike**, as everywhere else: a `drawPage` that throws is retired for
  the session and the body is left empty under a normal page.

Internally a custom page is an ordinary knobs page carrying a drawer, not a new
page kind — which is why every knobs-page behaviour (reads, turns, touch,
announce) applies to it unchanged.

##### A custom page as the level's preset browser

If the level declares the preset triple (`list_param` / `count_param` /
`name_param`), add `preset_browser` and the custom page **becomes** that browser
rather than a second page beside it:

```json
{ "key": "face", "name": "Face", "type": "canvas", "canvas_script": "canvas.js",
  "as_page": true, "preset_browser": true, "show_value": false }
```

Same jog, same enter/exit, same announcements — and it is emitted first, so it
is what you land on. `drawPage` additionally receives
`preset: { name, index, count, entered }`, because what is being browsed is not
a parameter and no read would find it.

Use it when a picture is a better picker than a row of text — a face per
character, a waveform per sample. Two pages, one showing the thing and one
naming it, are two doors onto the same choice.

#### The parameter card (`card_script`)

A `drawCell` widget replaces one cell's graphic. A **card** is the other surface:
a picture that floats over the whole page while a knob is held or has just been
turned, and is gone the moment you let go. Use it when a value needs more room
than a 17×15 box — a crossfade sitting between two named anchors, a feedback
amount that computes to a repeat count, a mode whose meaning is a diagram.

Declare it on the parameter, in the same `chain_params` entry the rest of the
knob comes from:

```json
{ "key": "blend", "name": "Blend", "type": "float", "min": 0, "max": 1,
  "card_script": "cards.js#blend_card", "card_w": 96, "card_h": 44 }
```

- `card_script` (required to get a card): `file.js#exportName`, spelled exactly
  like `canvas_script`. The file is resolved from the module root, and the
  export is looked up on `globalThis`.
- `card_w` / `card_h` (optional): the size you want, in pixels. Defaults are
  96×34; anything nonsense (zero, negative, NaN, a string) falls back to the
  default, and anything larger than the panel is clamped to it.

Then export the drawer:

```javascript
globalThis.blend_card = function (ctx, o) {
    ctx.print(1, 0, o.name, 1);
    ctx.print(o.w - 1 - ctx.textWidth(o.value), 0, o.value, 1);
    const v = Number(o.raw);
    if (isFinite(v)) ctx.fillRect(0, 12, Math.round(o.w * v), 6, 1);
};
```

**The card is not the screen, exactly as a widget's cell is not.** `(0,0)` is the
inside of the card — the host has already cleared it and drawn its border — and
`ctx.width` / `ctx.height` (also `o.w` / `o.h`) are that inside, not the display.
There is no accessor that reaches absolute space and nothing you draw outside
the card can land, which matters twice here: the size is per parameter, so
coordinates authored against one card are wrong on the next, and a card that
could paint past its own border would eat the page it exists to float over.
**Size everything against `o.w` / `o.h`; never write a fixed screen offset.**

**You get the value; you cannot read it.** `o.name` is the parameter's name,
`o.value` is the same formatted reading the header would show, and `o.raw` is
the wire value — **and `o.raw` may be `null`**, meaning the module did not answer
that read. Draw a word and stop when it does; a read that did not answer must
never become a picture. There is no `getParam` on this path (~2.8 ms, against a
1.68 ms whole-page render).

**You also get the rest of the page.** `o.values` is the page's value map — the
same object a cell widget is handed — for a card whose meaning depends on a
sibling: the vowel of *which* character, a ratio against *which* base, a time in
*whose* clock division. `o.nowMs` is a wall clock, for a card that animates
during the gesture that raised it. The null rules are identical: a sibling may
be missing or `null`, and an absent one must not become a picture either.

Without `o.values` such a card had no route to that fact at all — no `getParam`
here, and the card script is loaded into its own closure, so it cannot see a
variable the module's own `drawCell` set. The first module to need it went
through `globalThis` with a staleness timestamp, which worked and was a hidden
side channel between two files the contract said were unrelated.

**One strike.** A drawer that throws is retired for the session, the card is
left as an empty frame rather than a hole, and the parameter goes back to
drawing like any other — which is also what a host too old to know `card_script`
shows, so the degraded state is one you already ship.

**Keep the card file small and separate from `canvas.js`.** The host evaluates
the script on the first touch of a declaring knob. If your bank editor lives in
the same file, that whole file is evaluated on a gesture to reach one drawing
function.

#### Dynamic Target Pickers

Use `module_picker` and `parameter_picker` for chain-aware target routing without custom UI code.

- `module_picker`: Renders as a normal enum editor whose options are refreshed from currently loaded chain components.
- `parameter_picker`: Renders as a normal enum editor whose options are refreshed from the component selected by `target_key`.
- `allow_none` (optional, default true): Includes an empty option for clearing assignment.
- `allow_self` (module_picker only, optional, default false): Allows selecting the hosting component itself.
- `allowed_targets` (module_picker only, optional): Comma-separated string or array of target IDs to whitelist.
- `param_key` (module_picker, optional): Companion parameter key to clear when target changes (for example `lfo1_target_param`).
- `target_key` (parameter_picker, recommended): Companion key holding selected module target.
- `numeric_only` (parameter_picker, optional, default true): Restricts options to float/int parameters.

These map to knobs 1-8 in the Shadow UI for quick access.

  }
}
```

### `access` — which direction a param means something in

Optional on a `chain_params` entry. Defaults to `readwrite`; declare it when
your parameter is not both.

| value | meaning | host behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `readwrite` | an ordinary control (default) | turnable, divable if it has options |
| `read` | a **readout** — the value means something, writing means nothing | never turnable, never opens a picker, still refreshed on screen, and drawn inside a **dotted frame** |
| `write` | a **trigger** — writing does something, the value means nothing | never turnable, a click **fires** it |

```json
{"key": "detected_key", "type": "enum", "options": ["C","C#","D"], "access": "read"}
{"key": "rnd_preset",   "type": "enum", "options": ["—","Rnd!"],   "access": "write"}
```

**Why a readout needs saying.** `keydetect`'s `detected_key` is 25 key names
with no `set_param` branch at all — deliberately, and documented as such back
when an enum could only be nudged one detent at a time. Enums became divable in
1.0, so the picker opened on it and silently discarded whatever you chose. That
was a gap in the contract, not a bug in the module: display-only was never
expressible.

The cell says so too: a readout is **dotted** — the enum square draws its own
frame dotted, a dial or a big number gains a dotted frame around the cell. See
*Which widget a cell draws* above.

**Why a trigger needs saying, and why it is the more urgent half.** A momentary
action modelled as a two-option enum is a live hazard. `euclidrum`'s
`rnd_preset` declares `["—","Rnd!"]` and fires on anything that is not the
em-dash — so an **index** write of `"0"`, which *means* the em-dash, "do
nothing", randomises all eight lanes and destroys the kit. Declaring
`access: "write"` makes the host fire it through your own enum wire (the
**name**, if that is what your `get_param` reports) and never scrub it with a
knob, so the "do nothing" option can never be written by accident.

A trigger is not the same as a **switch**. `["Off","On"]` is a two-state
*setting* — it has a value worth reading, it should be turnable, and it draws as
a switch. Leave those as ordinary enums; roughly 150 params in the fleet are
switches and only about ten are triggers.

### `max_param` is NOT supported — publish a real `max`

Eight modules declare `"max_param": "preset_count"` (or similar) hoping the host
will resolve the bound at runtime. **Nothing has ever consumed it.** It is
parsed and then read by no one, in C or in JS.

Until 2026-08 it also *damaged* the parameter it decorated: the parser set an
internal `max_val = -1` marker that the chain host serialised literally, so sf2
shipped `{"min":0,"max":-1}` — an inverted range — and every other user lost its
declared bound. That marker is gone; a `max_param` declaration is now recorded
and otherwise inert, and your declared `max` survives.

It is deliberately not implemented, because the two real uses disagree about
what the referenced key means:

```
preset        max_param="preset_count"   wants count - 1   (7 modules)
laneN_pulses  max_param="laneN_steps"    wants the value   (eucalypso)
```

Picking one convention would silently be wrong for the other, which is the exact
failure this field already caused once.

**Do this instead:** emit a real `max`. Every module using `max_param` builds its
`chain_params` string at runtime from `get_param`, so it already knows the number
at the moment it serialises:

```c
/* not: "min":0,"max_param":"preset_count"   */
offset += snprintf(buf + offset, buf_len - offset,
    "{\"key\":\"preset\",\"type\":\"int\",\"min\":0,\"max\":%d}",
    preset_count > 0 ? preset_count - 1 : 0);
```

A knob declared `0..9999` against 27 real presets is ~99.7% dead travel, and
that shape is currently in `hera`, `surge`, `moog`, `minijv`, `helm`, `nusaw`,
`rex` and `obxd`.

### Recognized Units

The shared shadow-UI formatter (`src/shared/param_format.mjs`) renders any
`chain_params` entry that declares a `unit` field consistently across modules.
Recognized units:

| Unit  | Behavior                                                 | Example display     |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| `dB`  | Signed, decimals from `step` (fallback 1)                | `-6.0 dB`           |
| `Hz`  | Auto-scales to kHz at >= 1000                            | `440 Hz`, `1.50 kHz`|
| `ms`  | Non-negative, decimals from `step` (fallback 1)          | `12.5 ms`           |
| `sec` | Non-negative, decimals from `step` (fallback 3)          | `1.234 sec`         |
| `%`   | Values in `0..1` are scaled ×100; values >1 shown raw    | `50%`               |
| `st`  | Semitones; signed integer with explicit `+` prefix       | `+7 st`, `-3 st`    |
| `BPM` | Integer                                                  | `120 BPM`           |

Other unit strings are appended verbatim with a leading space (e.g. `unit:"cents"` → `"200 cents"`).

`display_format` (printf-style `.Nf` or `.N%`) overrides decimal selection but
still appends the unit suffix when present (e.g. `display_format:"%.2f"` with
`unit:"Hz"` → `"440.00 Hz"`).

For raw `set_param` writes the wire value never includes the unit suffix —
just the numeric string, with at least 3 decimals for floats.

#### `%` units and `max`

When using `unit:"%"`, **declare `max` explicitly** so the formatter knows
whether your raw values are normalized (`0..1`) or already in display range
(`0..100`). Without `max`, the default is `1` and the formatter scales by
×100 — a module that stores percentages as `0..100` and forgets `max:100`
will see `50` displayed as `5000%`.

#### Enum wire format

An enum can go over the `set_param` wire as its numeric INDEX or as its option
NAME. The UI **auto-detects which your plugin speaks** and latches the answer
per key: it looks at what `get_param` reports — a value that matches a declared
option means names, a value that parses as a number means indices, anything
else teaches nothing and leaves the question open for the next read.
Detection only ever uses values that came from the DSP, never values the UI
itself wrote (`learnEnumWireFormat` in `src/shared/param_format.mjs`); the
option picker asks the same question through `enumWireValue`.

`options_as_string: true` on the chain_params entry is therefore an **override,
not a requirement** — it is checked first and never learned over. Declare it if
you want the convention nailed down regardless of what your `get_param` says.

**The one obligation: a `set_param` that accepts only NAMES must report NAMES
from `get_param`.** That read is the only signal detection has. Report an index
while accepting only names and every write is discarded in silence — which is
exactly what the built-in `chord` module did: its `set_param` is a `strcmp`
ladder over the option names with **no trailing `else`**, so the value never
moved while the UI drew the index it had invented.

Two `set_param` shapes worth avoiding, both found in the fleet, neither of which
reports an error:

- **No trailing `else`** (chord) — an unrecognised value is silently ignored.
- **`else atof(val)`** (arp's `division`) — an unrecognised value is silently
  *accepted*, turning index `3` into a division of `3.0`.

Prefer accepting both conventions and rejecting anything else loudly enough to
show up in a log.

     markers; regenerate instead. -->

#### Which widget a cell draws

Authors do not pick a widget. Declare `type`, a range and `options`; the
widget follows. `drawKnobWidget` (`render_page_movy.mjs`) is one ordered
dispatch, and the order is the specification — each branch owns its cell
outright:

| # | test | widget | |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `kind === KIND_OPAQUE` | opaque box | ![opaque-box](images/widgets/opaque-box.png) |
| 2 | `writeOnly` (a trigger) | button | ![button](images/widgets/button.png) |
| 3 | `kind === KIND_ENUM` | enum square | ![enum-square](images/widgets/enum-square.png) |
| 4 | `shouldDrawBigNumber` | big number | ![big-number](images/widgets/big-number.png) |
| 5 | *(otherwise)* | arc knob | ![arc-knob](images/widgets/arc-knob.png) |

A **viz graphic** pre-empts all of it: a resolved group covers its cells and
draws one picture across them, and the per-cell widget is skipped.

Notes worth having before you declare something:

- **The opaque box shows three states** — a value, `NONE` for `""`, and
  `--` for a read that has not answered. Do not collapse the last two; an
  empty slot and a slow one are different facts.
- **A trigger is `access: "write"` on an ordinary enum**, not a type. The cap
  carries no text: the module reports a constant idle spelling and the fleet
  proves it is not readable (euclidrum's is an em-dash the 5x7 atlas cannot
  draw, which rendered as a blank square). The cell's label names the action.
  Fired by a jog click *or* a knob detent, either direction — the footer says
  `CLK FIRE` and `KNB FIRE`, one verb because it is one action. The knob
  path LATCHES: a whole spin is one fire, and the latch clears on RELEASE, or
  after `TRIGGER_KNOB_GESTURE_GAP_MS` of stillness if the cap sensor never
  registered. A rate limit was tried first and still fired eight times across
  a two-second spin.
- **`short_options` is for the enum square only.** The held-knob header keeps
  the full spelling, which is where a value has room to be read.
- **The big-number span bound is load-bearing.** An earlier version bounded at
  128 and drew 1392 params big, including `volume [0..100]` — a sweep, where
  an arc is the honest picture.
- **A modulated knob keeps the pointer on the base and adds a dot** at the live
  value. The dot is drawn even when they coincide: suppressing it there made a
  modulated knob pixel-identical to an unmodulated one.

  ![arc-knob-modulated](images/widgets/arc-knob-modulated.png)

#### Viz graphics

Detection runs in a fixed priority order and each detector gets first refusal
on unclaimed keys. A graphic must be **contiguous and within one row** — it
cannot span the label band between row 0 and row 1.

| graphic | from | |
|---|---|---|
| envelope | adjacent attack/decay/sustain/release | ![viz-envelope](images/widgets/viz-envelope.png) |
| filter | cutoff + resonance (mode/slope optional) | ![viz-filter](images/widgets/viz-filter.png) |
| lfo | shape + rate + depth, sharing a stem | ![viz-lfo](images/widgets/viz-lfo.png) |

- **An optional role is dropped when it does not fit.** `detectFilter` used to
  require every role it found to be contiguous, so a Mode knob parked at the far
  end of the page deleted the corroborated cutoff/resonance pair.
- **The switch takes `int` 0..1 as well as an Off/On enum** — 61 params across
  11 modules spell it that way and drew as a number, which is the one widget
  that tells you nothing. It draws both states, which is why it never raises the
  option-list peek.
- **The sample's file does not claim a cell.** It is `roles.value` — the
  waveform is drawn *from* it, never *on* it — because it dives to the file
  browser while every other member dives to the wave editor. With no file the
  graphic is not drawn at all and the cells fall back to their own widgets.
- **There is no representative shape.** A read that did not answer must never
  become a picture; the synthetic waveform that used to fill in for missing
  peaks drew a sample that was never loaded.

#### The marks

![brackets](images/widgets/brackets.png)

Corner brackets mean **the knob works, and it also opens something** —
`alsoOpens(meta)`, which in practice is a ranged `wav_position`. A viz group
wears one across its whole span when any covered cell `opensOnClick`.

See *Divability, and the two cell marks* below for why the brackets and the
chevron are not two spellings of one idea.

![readout](images/widgets/readout.png)

A **dotted frame** means `access: "read"` — telemetry you can look at and not
change. Each pair above is the same declaration with and without it.

The input layer has always honoured `access`: turning a readout shows the
reading and writes nothing, a click opens no picker, and `isDivable` /
`isTurnable` exclude it. The *drawing* did not, so a readout was
pixel-identical to a control — reported from the device as a knob that "does
not seem to do anything", which was a correct reading of the picture.

- **The rule is *a readout is dotted*; where the stroke lives is the widget's
  business.** A dial and a big number have none, so a frame is added around the
  cell; the enum square has one, so it dots that. One dotted rectangle per cell,
  never two. Either way the value does not move.
- **The square dots its own stroke because an outer frame did not work there.**
  Measured against an identical editable twin, an outer frame differed by 17
  pixels at full width against 27 at the narrow one — the wider the value, the
  more of the mark the square absorbed — and side by side the two cells were
  indistinguishable. It failed exactly where the feature is for: `keydetect`'s
  values are musical keys, always full width. Dotting the stroke inverts the
  gradient, to 39 against 26.
- **Not an inverted slab** — inversion already means *a finger is on this knob*
  in the label band and *this is the selection* in a list. **Not corner
  brackets** — those mean the opposite claim, that the knob works *and* opens
  something.
- **An opaque cell is not marked at all.** Its own notched frame is on the same
  rect, so an outer frame's dots would show only in the chevron's cut, and
  dotting that frame would blunt the one widget that says which direction its
  door goes.
- **A readout inside a viz graphic is not framed.** No fleet module has one;
  if one appears, mark the span once, the way the door bracket does.

#### Chrome

| | |
|---|---|
| ![chrome-header](images/widgets/chrome-header.png) | **Header** — where you are, and which page. The right side is a measured share against a `HEADER_MIN_LEFT` floor, not a fixed column. |
| ![chrome-header-held](images/widgets/chrome-header-held.png) | Holding a knob inverts the band and shows that parameter's full name and value. One clear row above and below is load-bearing *only* when inverted. |
| ![chrome-bank-bar](images/widgets/chrome-bank-bar.png) | **Bank bar** — one tick per page. It owns row 7, which is why a menu page cannot start its list at y=9 the way the enum picker does. |
| ![chrome-footer](images/widgets/chrome-footer.png) | **Footer** — hint pairs, key inverted into a pill. Fit-aware: three pairs need every word ≤4 chars, and a longer one drops a pair rather than overflowing. Hints come from the caller, never the renderer. |
| ![chrome-label-cell](images/widgets/chrome-label-cell.png) | **Label cell** — name at rest, value while held, `~` while modulated. Budgeted in *characters*, not pixels. |
| ![chrome-list](images/widgets/chrome-list.png) | **List** — one dotted column with a solid thumb, in `drawMenuList`, so every list in the tree has it. 2px thumb floor; the track covers the rows, not the rect; the selection highlight stops short of the gutter or it draws a phantom second thumb. |

#### Motion

Time is passed **in**, never read — there is no `Date.now()` in the renderer,
which is what lets a page be filmed deterministically.

**The store must be passed from the controller.** Every widget guards on
`anim && typeof nowMs === "number"`, so an undefined store draws the settled
frame forever — silently, and identically to a correct render of a value that
is not moving. `createAnimState` was written, exported, unit-tested and never
*called*; every animation below shipped inert for months.

*Slowed 5x — sampled at real time, so the curve is the device's.*

| | |
|---|---|
| ![motion-waveform](images/widgets/motion-waveform.gif) | **Waveform**, 100ms — one shape bends into the next. The enum peek is instant and covers this while it plays. |
| ![motion-enum](images/widgets/motion-enum.gif) | **Enum square**, 120ms — the frame travels, the glyphs swap outright. Text is served short while the box is narrow and completes as it arrives. |
| ![motion-button](images/widgets/motion-button.gif) | **Trigger**, 300ms — press then rings. Bursts append rather than replace, so a double-tap throws two. |

### `short_name` — a cell label that differs from the full name

The cell is five characters wide; the header is the width of the screen. They
want different words, so declare both:

```json
{ "key": "osc1_pitch", "name": "Osc 1 Pitch", "short_name": "Pitch" }
```

The cell draws `PITCH` where it drew `OSC1PIT`. The held-knob header and the
list keep `Osc 1 Pitch`, which is what tells you *which* oscillator you are
holding. Optional, and inert when absent — this is the same split
`short_options` already makes for enum values.

**Do not repeat the page in the cell.** A page called *Filter Envelope* has
already said "filter envelope", so its knobs are `Attack` and `Decay` — not
`F.Atk` or `FENVAT`.

Measured across the 39 catalogued modules by this author: 1766 controls on
knob pages, 1150 of them squeezed past being words, and **500 whose name
merely repeats their own page**. 425 of those stop being squeezed with a
`short_name` alone, with no change to what the header says.

It is still a label, so it is still fitted to the cell — a long `short_name`
is not a way to smuggle six characters into five.

**Drawn as you typed it, when it fits.** A `short_name` of `Noise` draws
`NOISE`, not the `NSE` the abbreviation table would pick, and `Amt` stays
`AMT` rather than being expanded back to `AMOUNT`. Only when what you typed is
too wide does the table get a say (`Sustain` → `SUS`), and only then the
squeeze. You are the author; the grid does not second-guess a word that fits.

##### A page can override it

`short_name` belongs to the parameter, and the same parameter can sit on more
than one page. `env_amount` on an *Envelope* page wants `Amt`; on a *Main*
page beside an LFO Amt, `Amt` would name them both. So a level may carry its
own, in the inline entry it already uses to name its params:

```json
"levels": {
  "envelope": { "params": [ { "key": "env_amount", "short_name": "Amt" } ] }
}
```

The level's value wins on its own page; the parameter's applies everywhere
else.

##### Four questions, in order

These came out of naming ~1100 controls across 39 modules. Each is a word you
can delete because something on screen already says it.

1. **Does the page say it?** A page titled *VCF* has said "filter", so
   `VCF Cutoff` is just `Cutoff`. A page titled *Filter Envelope* has said
   both, so its knobs are `Attack`, `Decay`, `Sustain`, `Release`.

2. **Does the widget say it?** A fader *is* a level — `Output Level` under a
   fader is just `Output`, and `Noise Volume` is `Noise`. A switch is an
   enable; an LFO graphic is an LFO; a waveform is a shape.

3. **Does the word imply its own domain?** Cutoff and resonance are a
   filter's; attack, decay, sustain and release are an envelope's. So
   `Filter 1 Cutoff` is `Cutoff 1` — the index survives and moves to the end,
   because it is the only part that distinguishes it.

4. **Do the neighbours say it?** If every cell on the page carries the same
   word, that word is context, and the one that differs should lead.

##### Two things not to do

**Never reduce to a bare index.** `Volume 1` under a fader is *not* `1`. Four
cells reading `1 2 3 4` beneath four identical faders are worse than
`VOL 1`. A word is only redundant when something else in the label still
carries meaning.

**Never make two cells on a page draw the same thing.** Check the whole page,
not the one control — and check every page the parameter appears on. An ugly
long label beats an ambiguous short one. `obxd` shipped two cells both
reading `OCTAVE`, because it names `octave` and `octave_transpose` alike.

##### When a word must shrink anyway

Take the **front** of it: `Compression` → `Comp`, `Panorama` → `Pano`,
`Algorithm` → `Algo`. A leading prefix is what a reader recognises, where a
devowelled skeleton (`CMPRS`, `PANRM`, `ALGRTH`) has to be decoded. The
exception is a prefix that reads as a different word — `Scatter` → `SCAT` and
`Restart` → `REST` mislead, so those devowel instead: `Scttr`, `Rstrt`.

For **two** words, devowelling wins and prefixing does not: `Feedback Tone` is
better as `FBTONE` than `FEETON`. Cut the words, not the label.


#### Divability, and the two cell marks

Every enum with a non-empty `options` array is **divable**: on the knob grid,
holding its knob and clicking opens a scrolling option list. You get this for
free — there is nothing to declare, and nothing to declare it away.

**A two-option param is turned differently, too, and how it is DRAWN decides
how it turns.**

- A param drawn as a **switch** — `Off`/`On`, or an `int` 0..1 — is
  **direction-absolute**: clockwise is on, anticlockwise is off. The switch has
  a track with its knob at one end, so the picture already tells you which way
  is which. Turning an already-on switch clockwise is a no-op, not a flip, and
  there is no gesture latch because the write is idempotent.
- A param drawn as the **enum square** — `Mix`/`Reverb`, `Saw`/`Square` — is a
  boxed value: both options sit in the same place, so it shows a state and names
  no direction. A detent **toggles** it whichever way you turned, and one flick
  of the encoder is one flip, not a dozen.

You do not choose between these; the widget rule does, and it follows your
`options`. Three or more options keep the four-detent gate and clamp at the
ends. A trigger (`access: "write"`) is never toggled and never draws as a
switch; it fires.

**Except at exactly two options, where there is no list to open.** On the knob
grid the click FLIPS it — the picker would show the value already in the cell
and the one other value there is — and the footer reads `CLK FLIP` rather than
`CLK OPEN`. The knob still steps it.

In the **list** view the same parameter is FOCUSED instead: click puts the row
into edit mode and the jog steps it, exactly like a float row. The flip only
saves a gesture when a knob is already under your hand, and in a list none is,
so flipping there would leave one row with no focus state while every other row
has one.

This is a different line from the `switch` distinction two sections up, and
they do not have to agree: a switch is a **boolean-flavoured** two-option enum
and only that group loses the peek, whereas *every* two-option enum flips —
`Mix`/`Reverb` included. The peek exists to show a word the cell has no room
for; the flip exists to save a gesture, and a choice pays that gesture exactly
as a boolean does.

Triggers (`access: "write"`) and readouts (`access: "read"`) are not divable at
all, so neither flips: a trigger is a two-option enum on the wire, and firing
it is not the same as setting it.

**The cell marks do not mean "divable."** Measured over the fleet (2026-08):
967 divable cells on knob pages, and **953 of them — 99% — wear no mark at
all**, because almost every divable cell is an enum. Divability is announced by
the **footer**: hold the knob and it reads `CLK OPEN`. Marking every enum would
erase what a mark means.

The two marks you *will* see distinguish something narrower, with no overlap
anywhere in the fleet — a handful of cells each:

| mark | knob turns it? | means |
|---|---|---|
| corner brackets | always | the knob works, **and** it opens something |
| chevron box | never | there is no knob here — only a door |

The **chevron is not a mark at all**: it is the *widget*. An opaque param
(`filepath`/`file`, `string`, `canvas`, non-ranged `wav_position`, the two
picker types) has no value-shape to draw, so `drawOpaqueBox`'s notched frame
with a chevron in its broken edge is simply what that cell looks like.

The **brackets** are an annotation on a working widget, and in practice mean
one thing: a **ranged `wav_position`** — a number a knob turns perfectly well
that *also* has a waveform editor behind it. The predicate is `alsoOpens()` in
`param_meta.mjs`; the underlying declaration fact is `meta.opaque_type`.

Module authors influence all of this only through `type`, `options`, and
whether a `wav_position` declares `min`/`max`.

### Knob Acceleration

All chain / master-FX / slot / patch param knob edits share one acceleration
curve from `src/shared/knob_engine.mjs`. Modules don't opt in — every numeric
adjust path runs through the same engine.

| Time since last tick | Step divisor          |
|----------------------|-----------------------|
| First tick (cold)    | 1 (unscaled "click")  |
| < 50 ms              | 4 (fast sweep)        |
| 50 – 150 ms          | 8                     |
| > 150 ms             | 16 (fine control)     |
| > 2 seconds          | self-reset (staleness)|

`int` and `enum` params accumulate raw ticks until the divisor threshold,
then emit `floor(|accum| / divisor)` integer steps per call so a fast jog
sweep (batched delta) advances proportionally — a delta of 8 with divisor=4
emits 2 steps. `enum` types use a fixed `enum_divisor = 10` ticks per option
regardless of count — binary toggles and 47-option pickers feel equally
snappy.

The engine **self-resets** after a >2 second idle gap, so re-entering a
parameter editor after a long pause feels like a fresh edit rather than
continuing a stale acceleration curve. There's no JS-side lifecycle plumbing
to maintain — the engine handles it internally.

Default float step (when a chain_params entry doesn't declare `step`) is
`0.01`. Default int step is `1`. Modules that need a different feel should
declare `step` explicitly. (Note: this is half the previous default of
`0.02` for floats — most modules already declare step, so this is invisible
in practice.)

## Help Content (help.json)

Modules can provide on-device help accessible from the Shadow UI's Help viewer (Global Settings → System → Help). Add a `help.json` file to your module's source directory.

### File Location

```
src/modules/your-module/
  module.json
  ui.js
  help.json          # Help content for the Help viewer
```

The host scans all installed module directories for `help.json` at runtime. Module help topics appear alphabetically in the "Modules" section of the Help viewer.

They are also reachable **in place**: a chain component whose module ships a
`help.json` with a non-empty `children` array gets a **`Module Help`** row on the
`Module` page at the end of its knob-grid jog sequence, which opens that module's
topics directly (Back returns to the module, not up into the Help tree). A module
with no help content gets no row — an empty viewer is worse than no door — so
shipping `help.json` is what puts your help one jog from your controls.

### Format

Help content is a tree of sections and leaf topics:

```json
{
  "title": "Your Module",
  "children": [
    {
      "title": "Overview",
      "lines": [
        "Brief description",
        "of your module.",
        "",
        "Second paragraph",
        "with more detail."
      ]
    },
    {
      "title": "Controls",
      "children": [
        {
          "title": "Knob Mapping",
          "lines": [
            "Knob 1: Cutoff",
            "Knob 2: Resonance",
            "Knob 3: Attack",
            "Knob 4: Release"
          ]
        },
        {
          "title": "Other Settings",
          "lines": [
            "Detail about other",
            "settings here."
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "title": "MIDI",
      "lines": [
        "MIDI behavior",
        "description."
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Node Types

| Type | Fields | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Branch | `title`, `children` | Navigable folder (shows as a list) |
| Leaf | `title`, `lines` | Scrollable text content |

- **Branch nodes** have a `children` array of other branch or leaf nodes. Nesting depth is unlimited.
- **Leaf nodes** have a `lines` array of strings displayed as scrollable text.

**The top-level object MUST have `children`.** The loader's whole test is
`if (helpData.children) helpMap[id] = helpData.children;` — a file that parses
as valid JSON but names its topics something else (`sections`, `pages`,
`parameters`) is **discarded without a word**, and the viewer shows "No help
content available for this module" as though the file were absent. A 2026-08
sweep of the catalog found 12 modules in exactly that state, several of them
carrying several KB of carefully written help nobody could read. `title` and
any other sibling keys are ignored; `children` is the only one that is read.

### Text Formatting Rules

The display is 128x64 pixels and a help line is **drawn, never wrapped and
never truncated**. `drawScrollableText` calls `print(4, y, line)`, `print()`
walks the string one glyph at a time, and everything past x=127 is dropped by
`set_pixel` with no error anywhere. So an over-long line loses its tail
silently — there is no ellipsis and nothing in the log.

**The budget is pixels, not characters.** The atlas is fixed-pitch, but
`load_font` auto-trims every glyph to its own inked extent, so text is
*proportional* on screen: `.` advances 3 px and `W` advances 6 px. Roughly 20
average characters fit, which is why the guidance below is 20 — but a line of
narrow letters can run longer and a line of capitals can overflow sooner. If
you are near the edge, measure rather than count.

- Keep lines to about **20 characters**, and treat that as a budget to check
  rather than a number to trust. A 2026-08 sweep of the catalog found 27
  modules shipping lines that genuinely run off the screen, the worst by 100 px
  — most of a second line's worth of text, invisible.
- **Stay in ASCII.** The bitmap font carries the printable ASCII range plus
  exactly `Ä Ö Ü ä ö ü € † ‡ °`. Any other character — an em dash, a curly
  quote, `≥`, an arrow — has no glyph, and `glyph()` renders it as a bare 1 px
  gap. It does not fall back to anything.

`tests/host/test_help_content_width.sh` measures the host's own help content
this way, deriving the glyph widths from the `FONT` table in
`scripts/generate_font.py`.
- Use empty strings (`""`) for blank lines between paragraphs
- Indent continuation lines with a leading space for readability:
  ```json
  "lines": [
    "Knob 3: Contour",
    " (filter env depth)"
  ]
  ```

### Packaging

Include `help.json` in your build script so it ends up in the distributed tarball:

```bash
# In scripts/build.sh, after copying other files to dist/<id>/
[ -f src/help.json ] && cp src/help.json dist/<id>/help.json
```

The host discovers `help.json` automatically — no changes to `module.json` are needed.

### Recommended Sections

A typical module help file includes:

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Overview | What the module does, key features |
| Controls / Knob Mapping | Which knobs control which parameters |
| MIDI | MIDI behavior, supported CCs, channel info |
| Presets | List of factory presets (if applicable) |

## Example Modules

See these modules for reference:

- **chain**: Signal chain with synths, MIDI FX, and audio FX
- **dexed**: Dexed FM synthesizer with native DSP (loads .syx patches)
- **sf2**: SoundFont synthesizer with native DSP
- **m8**: MIDI translator (UI-only, no DSP)
- **controller**: MIDI controller with banks (UI-only)

## Signal Chain Module

The Signal Chain module allows combining MIDI sources, MIDI effects, sound generators, and audio effects into configurable patches.

### Chain Structure

```
[Input or MIDI Source] → [MIDI FX] → [Sound Generator] → [Audio FX] → [Output]
```

### Available Components

| Type | Components |
|------|------------|
| MIDI Sources | Sequencers or other modules referenced via `midi_source` |
| Sound Generators | Line In, SF2, Dexed, CLAP, plus any module marked `"chainable": true` with `"component_type": "sound_generator"` (for example `obxd`, `minijv`) |
| MIDI Effects | Chord (15 chord types with inversions, voicings, strum), Arpeggiator (off, up, down, up_down, random with BPM/division/sync), Velocity Scale (min/max velocity mapping), Stacks (chord progression on a note grid; reads and stamps Move clips), plus external MIDI FX from the catalog |
| Audio Effects | Freeverb (reverb), CLAP effects, plus external audio FX from the catalog (CloudSeed, PSXVerb, Tapescam, etc.) |

### CLAP Host Module

The CLAP module (separate repo: `move-anything-clap`) hosts arbitrary CLAP audio plugins:

- Place `.clap` plugin files in `/data/UserData/schwung/modules/clap/plugins/`
- Plugins are discovered at load time
- Use jog wheel to browse plugins, encoders to control parameters
- CLAP synths work as sound generators in Signal Chain
- CLAP effects can be used in the audio FX slot

### Patch Files

Patches are stored in `/data/UserData/schwung/patches/` on the device as JSON:

```json

            {
                "type": "freeverb",
                "params": {
                    "room_size": 0.8,
                    "wet": 0.3
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

JavaScript MIDI FX can be added per patch:

```json
"midi_fx_js": ["octave_up", "fifths"]
```

### Line In Sound Generator

The Line In sound generator passes external audio through the chain for processing:

```json
{
    "name": "Line In + Reverb",
    "chain": {
        "synth": {
            "module": "linein",
            "config": {}
        },
        "audio_fx": [
            {"type": "freeverb", "params": {"wet": 0.4}}
        ]
    }
}
```

Note: Audio input routing depends on the last selected input in the stock Move interface.

## Audio FX Plugin API

Audio effects use an in-place processing API. The v2 API supports multiple instances:

**Filename:** When loaded inside Signal Chain, the chain host expects the shared library at `modules/audio_fx/<id>/<id>.so` — it does not read `module.json`'s `dsp` field. Name your audio FX shared library `<module-id>.so` (e.g. `freeverb.so`, `cloudseed.so`), not `dsp.so`.

```c
typedef struct audio_fx_api_v2 {
    uint32_t api_version;
    void* (*create_instance)(const char *module_dir, const char *config_json);
    void (*destroy_instance)(void *instance);
    void (*process_block)(void *instance, int16_t *audio_inout, int frames);
    void (*set_param)(void *instance, const char *key, const char *val);
    int (*get_param)(void *instance, const char *key, char *buf, int buf_len);
    void (*on_midi)(void *instance, const uint8_t *msg, int len, int source);  // Optional
} audio_fx_api_v2_t;

// Entry point
audio_fx_api_v2_t* move_audio_fx_init_v2(const host_api_v1_t *host);
```

The `on_midi` callback is optional (can be NULL). Implement it to receive MIDI from capture rules or other sources.

## MIDI FX Plugin API

MIDI effects transform or generate MIDI messages. They use a separate API defined in `src/host/midi_fx_api_v1.h`:

```c
typedef struct midi_fx_api_v1 {
    uint32_t api_version;  /* Must be 1 (MIDI_FX_API_VERSION) */

    void* (*create_instance)(const char *module_dir, const char *config_json);
    void (*destroy_instance)(void *instance);

    /* Transform incoming MIDI. Returns number of output messages (0 = swallow, >1 = expand).
     * out_msgs: array of 3-byte MIDI messages
     * max_out: maximum output messages (MIDI_FX_MAX_OUT_MSGS = 16) */
    int (*process_midi)(void *instance,
                        const uint8_t *in_msg, int in_len,
                        uint8_t out_msgs[][3], int out_lens[],
                        int max_out);

    /* Time-based generation (e.g., arpeggiator). Called each audio block.
     * Returns number of output messages to inject. */
    int (*tick)(void *instance,
                int frames, int sample_rate,
                uint8_t out_msgs[][3], int out_lens[],
                int max_out);

    void (*set_param)(void *instance, const char *key, const char *val);
    int (*get_param)(void *instance, const char *key, char *buf, int buf_len);
} midi_fx_api_v1_t;

// Entry point
midi_fx_api_v1_t* move_midi_fx_init(const host_api_v1_t *host);
```

**Key differences from sound generators and audio FX:**

- `process_midi()` transforms incoming MIDI — can output 0 (swallow), 1 (pass/modify), or multiple messages (e.g., chord generates multiple notes)
- `tick()` handles time-based generation (e.g., arpeggiator note sequencing) — called every audio block
- No `render_block()` — MIDI FX don't process audio
- Maximum 2 native MIDI FX per chain (`MAX_MIDI_FX`)
- Maximum 16 output messages per `process_midi()` call (`MIDI_FX_MAX_OUT_MSGS`)

### Building MIDI FX

MIDI FX are built identically to other native plugins:

```bash
"${CROSS_PREFIX}gcc" -g -O3 -shared -fPIC \
    src/modules/midi_fx/your-fx/dsp/your_fx.c \
    -o build/modules/midi_fx/your-fx/dsp.so \
    -Isrc
```

### Built-in MIDI FX

| Module | ID | Description |
|--------|----|-------------|
| Chord | `chord` | Chord generator (15 types, inversions, voicings, strum) |
| Arpeggiator | `arp` | Arpeggiator (up, down, up_down, random with tempo sync) |
| Velocity Scale | `velocity_scale` | Velocity range mapping (min/max) |
| Stacks | `stacks` | Chord progression sequencer drawn on a note grid |

#### Stacks

A port of Live 12's Stacks generator. Live's writes a progression into a clip;
Move has no clip a MIDI FX can write to, so this plays the same data model in
real time and offers the round trip explicitly: **Read Clip** parses the playing
clip out of the current set's `Song.abl` and names its chords, you edit them on
the grid, **Preview** auditions, and **Stamp Clip** puts it back.

It is also the worked example for three things a module author will otherwise
have to infer:

- **A module page that is a picture.** `view` is a `type: "canvas"` param with
  `as_page: true`, so the grid is a page in the level's jog rotation carrying
  the level's own knobs — the eight encoders work with no input code.
- **One read that draws everything.** The staff needs every chord's name,
  length, offset and resolved pitches. That is one `viz.extra_keys` read
  (`prog`), not one per chord, because a read is ~2.8 ms against a 1.68 ms page
  render. The C side publishes the *resolved* notes so voicing is not
  reimplemented in JS.
- **File I/O from a MIDI FX.** Every entry point is the SPI callback, so
  `set_param` only bumps an atomic counter; a worker thread created with
  `PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED` + `SCHED_OTHER` does the parsing and publishes with
  a release-store. Inheriting the callback's FIFO 70 would starve Move's own
  `Link Main` at 35.

Two rules worth lifting out of it. **The chord-shape table is ordered by
family** (`5th`, `triad`, `6th`, `7th`, `9th`, `ext`) and that ordering is
load-bearing: `family` jumps `shape` to the first row of a family and `shape`
steps within it, which is how 37 shapes stay usable on one enum knob without a
dynamically-served `chain_params` the grid would cache and settle on. And
**humanise is a hash, not a generator** — the deviation for a note is a pure
function of (seed, chord, voice), so the take repeats until you press Randomize
and the clip Stamp writes is the one Preview played.

### MIDI FX module.json Example

```json
{
    "id": "velocity_scale",
    "name": "Velocity Scale",
    "abbrev": "VS",
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "builtin": true,
    "capabilities": {
        "chainable": true,
        "component_type": "midi_fx",
        "ui_hierarchy": {
            "levels": {
                "root": {
                    "name": "Velocity Scale",
                    "params": [
                        {"key": "min", "name": "Min", "type": "int", "min": 1, "max": 127},
                        {"key": "max", "name": "Max", "type": "int", "min": 1, "max": 127}
                    ],
                    "knobs": ["min", "max"]
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Host API (Passed to Plugins)

All plugin init functions receive a `host_api_v1_t` struct providing access to host services:

```c
typedef struct host_api_v1 {
    uint32_t api_version;

    /* Audio constants */
    int sample_rate;         /* 44100 */
    int frames_per_block;    /* 128 */

    /* Direct mailbox access (use with care) */
    uint8_t *mapped_memory;
    int audio_out_offset;    /* Offset to audio output in mailbox */
    int audio_in_offset;     /* Offset to audio input in mailbox */

    /* Logging */
    void (*log)(const char *msg);

    /* MIDI send functions
     * msg: 4-byte USB-MIDI packet [cable|CIN, status, data1, data2]
     * Returns: bytes queued, or 0 on failure */
    int (*midi_send_internal)(const uint8_t *msg, int len);
    int (*midi_send_external)(const uint8_t *msg, int len);

    /* Clock status for sync-aware plugins */
    int (*get_clock_status)(void);

    /* Transport beat position for phase-locked sync. Beats elapsed since the
     * active transport's start, derived from 24-PPQN MIDI clock and
     * interpolated per audio block, tracking whichever transport is playing —
     * Move's native sequencer (cable-0 clock) or an internal overtake
     * sequencer that emits clock (e.g. movy). Returns < 0 when no transport is
     * running (callers should fall back, e.g. free-run an LFO). Use this
     * instead of accumulating phase from get_bpm() to stay drift-free and
     * bar-aligned. May be NULL on older hosts — always guard. Appended 2026-07. */
    double (*get_beat_position)(void);
} host_api_v1_t;
```

**Tempo while stopped:** `get_bpm()` retains the last-playing transport's tempo
after it stops (so a synced LFO that switches from phase-lock to free-run keeps
the same rate). It updates from emitted clock, so changing an internal
sequencer's tempo while it is *stopped* is not reflected until it plays again.

## Audio Specifications

- Sample rate: 44100 Hz
- Block size: 128 frames
- Latency: ~3ms
- Format: Stereo interleaved int16

## Shadow Mode Integration

Shadow Mode runs custom signal chains alongside stock Ableton Move. Your modules are **automatically available** in shadow mode without any additional work - no recompilation required.

### How It Works

Shadow mode loads the chain module and patches. When you install a module via Schwung Manager (or manually copy it to the modules directory), it becomes available in Shadow Mode.

Modules and patches are read from:
- Modules: `/data/UserData/schwung/modules/`
- Patches: `/data/UserData/schwung/patches/`

### Making Your Module Shadow-Compatible

If your module is chainable (sound generator or audio FX), it works in shadow mode automatically. Ensure your `module.json` has:

```json
{
    "capabilities": {
        "chainable": true,
        "component_type": "sound_generator"
    }
}
```

Valid `component_type` values for chainable modules:
- `sound_generator` - Synths and samplers
- `audio_fx` - Audio effects

### Creating Shadow Chain Patches

Patches are JSON files in `/data/UserData/schwung/patches/`. To create a patch using your module:

```json
{
    "name": "My Synth + Reverb",
    "version": 1,
    "chain": {
        "input": "pads",
        "synth": {
            "module": "your-module-id",
            "config": {
                "preset": 0
            }
        },
        "audio_fx": [
            {
                "type": "freeverb",
                "params": {
                    "room_size": 0.7,
                    "wet": 0.25
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

The `module` field must match the `id` in your module's `module.json`.

### Shadow Mode MIDI Routing

Each shadow slot listens on a configurable MIDI channel (default 1-4):

| Shadow Slot | Default Channel |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Slot A | Ch 1 |
| Slot B | Ch 2 |
| Slot C | Ch 3 |
| Slot D | Ch 4 |

**Forward Channel:** Some synths need MIDI on a specific channel regardless of slot. Configure via the slot's "Forward Ch" setting:
- **Auto**: Pass MIDI through on the receive channel (default)
- **1-16**: Remap all MIDI to that specific channel before sending to the synth

Each shadow slot can load a different chain patch. Slot settings and synth states persist across restarts.

### Making a module compatible with Module Presets

The shadow UI lets users save/recall **module presets** — per-component snapshots of a
single chain component's state (one synth's patch, one FX's setting), independent of the
whole-chain patch. The feature is **generic and needs no per-module code**: it captures and
restores the same opaque `state` blob the host already uses for per-slot autosave. A module
is preset-compatible as long as it honors that state contract:

- `get_param("state", buf, len)` returns the module's **full, self-contained** state
  (everything needed to reproduce the current sound — not a reference/index into a bank).
- `set_param("<prefix>:state", blob)` restores it. The host drives recall through the
  verified slot-load restore path; `<prefix>` is the component slot (`synth`, `fx1`..`fxN`,
  or `midi_fx1`) and is supplied by the host.

Modules that already support per-slot autosave get module presets for free. A module that
doesn't expose a self-contained `state` (or that returns a referential blob) won't produce a
usable preset, so make `state` round-trip-complete. (User-facing usage is covered in the
manual.)

#### If you implement no `state` at all

Your parameters do not survive a reboot. That is the expected cost and it is
yours alone to pay — **but until 2026-08 it was not.** The host asked for
`state`, could not tell `""` ("this module declares none") apart from `null`
("the read did not complete"), and took the second reading: it then skipped the
save to avoid clobbering a good file with defaults, and skipped it for the
**whole slot**, including the other components in it.

So a slot containing `denis` or `branchage` never autosaved *anything*, ever —
not the synth, not the FX behind it — and silently, because the thing that fires
is a guard designed to leave your file alone. Fixed; the two answers are kept
apart now.

The obligation this leaves you: **answer the `state` query one way or the
other.** Return your blob, or return `-1` / an empty buffer to say you have
none. What you must not do is fail to answer — a read that times out is still
indistinguishable from a module that is simply slow, and the host will (rightly)
protect the existing file rather than overwrite it with defaults. If your
`get_param` can block — see the threading section; several modules read files
from it — that is the same bug wearing a different hat.

### Testing Shadow Mode

1. Build and install Schwung: `./scripts/build.sh && ./scripts/install.sh local`
2. Launch stock Move (or reboot device)
3. Toggle shadow mode: **Shift + touch Volume + touch Knob 1**
4. Use jog wheel to select a slot, click to browse patches
5. Load a patch that uses your module
6. Set a Move track to MIDI channel 5-8 and play pads

### Capture Rules

Chain patches can capture specific Move controls exclusively. When a slot with capture rules is focused in the shadow UI, captured controls are blocked from reaching Move and routed to the slot's DSP.

**Patch-level capture:**

```json
{
    "name": "Performance Effect",
    "synth": { "module": "sf2" },
    "audio_fx": [{ "type": "freeverb" }],
    "capture": {
        "groups": ["steps"]
    }
}
```

**Capture format:**

```json
{
    "capture": {
        "groups": ["steps", "pads"],
        "notes": [60, 61, 62],
        "note_ranges": [[68, 75]],
        "ccs": [118, 119],
        "cc_ranges": [[100, 110]]
    }
}
```

All fields are optional and combine as a union.

**Control group aliases:**

| Alias | Type | Values | Description |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| `pads` | notes | 68-99 | 32 performance pads |
| `steps` | notes | 16-31 | 16 step sequencer buttons |
| `tracks` | CCs | 40-43 | 4 track buttons |
| `knobs` | CCs | 71-78 | 8 encoders (relative) |
| `knobs_abs` | CCs | 102-109 | 8 knobs (absolute 0-127, scaled to assigned param range) |
| `jog` | CC | 14 | Main encoder |

**Module-level capture (for Master FX):**

Audio FX modules can define capture rules in their `module.json`:

```json
{
    "id": "perfverb",
    "capabilities": {
        "component_type": "audio_fx",
        "capture": {
            "groups": ["steps"]
        }
    }
}
```

**Note:** Audio FX modules that want to receive captured MIDI must implement `on_midi` in their API. If `on_midi` is NULL, captured MIDI is blocked from Move but not routed to the FX.

### Shadow Mode Configuration

Shadow slot configuration is stored in `/data/UserData/schwung/shadow_chain_config.json`:

```json
{
    "patches": [
        { "name": "SF2 + Freeverb", "channel": 5 },
        { "name": "Dexed + Freeverb", "channel": 6 },
        { "name": "OB-Xd + Freeverb", "channel": 7 },
        { "name": "Mini-JV + Freeverb", "channel": 8 }
    ]
}
```

The shadow UI updates this file when you select patches for each slot.

## Overtake Modules

Overtake modules take complete control of Move's UI while running in shadow mode. Unlike regular shadow mode (which displays a custom UI alongside Move), overtake modules fully replace Move's display and control all LEDs.

### Configuration

Set `component_type: "overtake"` in module.json:

```json
{
    "id": "controller",
    "name": "MIDI Controller",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "component_type": "overtake",
    "ui": "ui.js",
    "api_version": 2
}
```

Overtake modules appear in a dedicated section of the shadow UI menu.

### Lifecycle

When an overtake module is loaded:

1. **LED Clearing**: The host progressively clears all LEDs (pads, steps, buttons, knob indicators)
2. **Loading Screen**: "Loading..." is displayed during LED clearing
3. **Deferred Init**: After ~500ms delay, the module's `init()` is called
4. **Module Takes Over**: Module controls display and all LEDs

The progressive LED clearing prevents MIDI buffer overflow (the buffer holds ~64 packets).

#### Optional lifecycle hooks

Beyond `init()`, `tick()`, and `onMidiMessageInternal()`/`onMidiMessageExternal()`, overtake modules may define two optional hooks:

- `globalThis.onUnload()` — called once when the module is being torn down. Use it to release resources or persist state.
- `globalThis.onResume()` — called once each time a suspended `suspend_keeps_js` overtake module is brought back to the foreground. It is **not** called on first load (`init()` handles that). While the module was backgrounded its hardware LEDs were cleared, so the typical use is to invalidate any on-change LED delta-cache and force a full repaint on the next `tick()`. Both hooks are opt-in: modules that do not define them are unaffected.

### Host-Level Escape

The host provides a built-in escape mechanism that always works, regardless of module implementation:

**Shift + Volume Touch + Jog Click** exits any overtake module

The host tracks shift and volume touch state locally (not relying on the shim's tracking, which doesn't work in overtake mode) to ensure the escape always functions.

### Progressive LED Handling

The MIDI output buffer is limited (~64 packets). Sending all LED commands at once causes buffer overflow. Use progressive LED handling:

**In the host (LED clearing):**
```javascript
const LEDS_PER_BATCH = 20;
let ledClearIndex = 0;

function clearLedBatch() {
    // Clear 20 LEDs per frame until done
    // Covers: pads (68-99), steps (16-31), buttons, knob indicators
}
```

**In your module (initialization):**

Use the shared `setLED()` and `setButtonLED()` from `input_filter.mjs` — they provide caching (skip duplicate sends) and correct MIDI packet formatting:

```javascript
import {
    MoveBack, MoveCapture, MoveUndo, MoveLoop, MoveCopy, MoveMute, MoveDelete,
    MovePads, White, DarkGrey,
    WhiteLedDim, WhiteLedMedium, WhiteLedBright
} from '/data/UserData/schwung/shared/constants.mjs';

import { setLED, setButtonLED } from '/data/UserData/schwung/shared/input_filter.mjs';

let ledInitPending = false;
let ledInitIndex = 0;
const LEDS_PER_FRAME = 8;

globalThis.init = function() {
    ledInitPending = true;
    ledInitIndex = 0;
};

function setupLedBatch() {
    const leds = [];
    // Button LEDs (CC-based) — use setButtonLED
    leds.push({ type: 'cc', id: MoveBack, color: WhiteLedDim });
    leds.push({ type: 'cc', id: MoveCapture, color: WhiteLedDim });
    // Pad LEDs (note-based) — use setLED
    for (const pad of MovePads) {
        leds.push({ type: 'note', id: pad, color: DarkGrey });
    }

    const end = Math.min(ledInitIndex + LEDS_PER_FRAME, leds.length);
    for (let i = ledInitIndex; i < end; i++) {
        if (leds[i].type === 'cc') setButtonLED(leds[i].id, leds[i].color);
        else setLED(leds[i].id, leds[i].color);
    }
    ledInitIndex = end;
    if (ledInitIndex >= leds.length) ledInitPending = false;
}

globalThis.tick = function() {
    if (ledInitPending) {
        setupLedBatch();
    }
    drawUI();
};
```

**Important:** Always use the shared `setLED()` and `setButtonLED()` from `input_filter.mjs` rather than calling `move_midi_internal_send()` directly. The shared helpers handle LED caching and correct USB-MIDI cable byte formatting. Use absolute import paths (`/data/UserData/schwung/shared/...`) for module location independence.

### LED Addresses

When clearing or setting LEDs, address both note-based and CC-based LEDs:

| Type | Addressing | Values |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Pads | Notes | 68-99 |
| Steps | Notes | 16-31 |
| Knob touch | Notes | 0-7 |
| Step icons | CCs | 16-31 |
| Track buttons | CCs | 40-43 |
| Shift | CC | 49 |
| Menu/Back/Capture | CCs | 50-52 |
| Up/Down | CCs | 54-55 |
| Undo/Loop/Copy | CCs | 56, 58, 60 |
| Left/Right | CCs | 62-63 |
| Knob indicators | CCs | 71-78 |
| Play/Rec | CCs | 85-86 |
| Mute | CC | 88 |
| Record/Delete | CCs | 118-119 |

### MIDI Routing

In overtake mode:
- All internal MIDI is passed to the module's `onMidiMessageInternal`
- External MIDI is passed to `onMidiMessageExternal`
- The host intercepts Shift+Vol+Jog before the module sees it (for escape)
- Modules can send MIDI out via `move_midi_external_send` and `move_midi_internal_send`

### Example: MIDI Controller

The built-in MIDI Controller module (`src/modules/controller/`) demonstrates overtake patterns:

- 16 banks of pad/knob mappings
- Step buttons switch banks
- Jog wheel and Up/Down buttons for octave shift
- Progressive LED initialization
- Dynamic C note highlighting based on octave

## Publishing to the Module Catalog

External modules are distributed through the module catalog. Users browse, install, update and remove modules in **Schwung Manager**, the web interface the Move serves on port 7700 — the single install/update path. (The on-device store was retired: its privileged writes silently no-opped for devices without a current shim. On the Move itself, **Global Settings → System → Web Manager** shows the device's IP and a QR code for reaching the manager.)

### Requirements

1. Module builds as a self-contained tarball: `<id>-module.tar.gz`
2. Tarball extracts to a folder matching the module ID (e.g., `minijv/`)
3. GitHub repository with releases enabled
4. GitHub Actions workflow for automated builds

### Tarball Structure

```
<id>-module.tar.gz
  └── <id>/
      ├── module.json       # Required
      ├── ui.js             # Optional: JavaScript UI
      ├── dsp.so            # Optional: Native DSP plugin
      └── ...               # Other module files
```

### Release Workflow

1. **Make changes and update version** in `src/module.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "version": "0.2.0"
   }
   ```

2. **Commit and tag the release**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Release v0.2.0"
   git tag v0.2.0
   git push && git push --tags
   ```

3. **GitHub Actions automatically**:
   - Builds the module using Docker cross-compilation
   - Creates `<id>-module.tar.gz`
   - Attaches it to the GitHub release

4. **Update the catalog** in `move-anything/module-catalog.json` (if not already listed):
   ```json
   {
     "id": "your-module",
     "name": "Your Module",
     "description": "What it does",
     "author": "Your Name",
     "component_type": "sound_generator",
     "github_repo": "username/move-anything-yourmodule",
     "default_branch": "main",
     "asset_name": "your-module-module.tar.gz",
     "min_host_version": "0.3.0",
     "requires": "Optional: external assets needed (e.g. sample files, ROMs)"
   }
   ```

5. **Commit catalog update**:
   ```bash
   cd move-anything
   git add module-catalog.json
   git commit -m "Update your-module to v0.2.0"
   git push
   ```

### GitHub Actions Workflow Template

Add `.github/workflows/release.yml` to your module repository:

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Docker
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3

      - name: Build module
        run: ./scripts/build.sh

      - name: Package module
        run: |
          cd dist
          tar -czvf ../${{ github.event.repository.name }}-module.tar.gz */

      - name: Create Release
        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
        with:
          files: ${{ github.event.repository.name }}-module.tar.gz
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Update release.json
        run: |
          VERSION="${GITHUB_REF_NAME#v}"
          git fetch origin main
          git checkout -f main
          git config user.name "github-actions[bot]"
          git config user.email "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"

          cat > release.json << EOF
          {
            "version": "${VERSION}",
            "download_url": "https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/releases/download/${{ github.ref_name }}/${{ github.event.repository.name }}-module.tar.gz"
          }
          EOF

          git add release.json
          git commit -m "chore: update release.json for ${{ github.ref_name }}" || echo "No changes to commit"
          git push origin main
```

### Catalog Entry Schema (v2)

Each module in `module-catalog.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "module-id",
  "name": "Display Name",
  "description": "Short description",
  "author": "Author Name",
  "component_type": "sound_generator|audio_fx|midi_fx|overtake|utility|tool",
  "github_repo": "username/repo-name",
  "default_branch": "main",
  "asset_name": "module-id-module.tar.gz",
  "min_host_version": "0.3.0",
  "requires": "Optional: external assets needed (e.g. ROM files, .sf2 soundfonts)"
}
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | Yes | Module ID (lowercase hyphenated) |
| `name` | Yes | Display name |
| `description` | Yes | Short description |
| `author` | Yes | Author name |
| `component_type` | Yes | `sound_generator`, `audio_fx`, `midi_fx`, `overtake`, `utility`, `tool` |
| `github_repo` | Yes | GitHub `owner/repo` |
| `default_branch` | Yes | Branch to fetch `release.json` from (usually `main`) |
| `asset_name` | Yes | Expected tarball filename |
| `min_host_version` | Yes | Minimum compatible host version |
| `requires` | No | User-facing note about required external assets |

### release.json

Each module repo must have a `release.json` on its main branch. Schwung Manager fetches this file (not the GitHub releases API) to determine the latest version and download URL.

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "download_url": "https://github.com/username/move-anything-mymodule/releases/download/v0.2.0/mymodule-module.tar.gz"
}
```

For a repository that publishes more than one catalog module, use a `modules`
object keyed by the exact catalog IDs. Each entry has the same fields as a
single-module release:

```json
{
  "modules": {
    "module-a": {
      "version": "0.2.0",
      "download_url": "https://github.com/username/repo/releases/download/v0.2.0/module-a-module.tar.gz"
    },
    "module-b": {
      "version": "0.2.0",
      "download_url": "https://github.com/username/repo/releases/download/v0.2.0/module-b-module.tar.gz"
    }
  }
}
```

Schwung Manager and the shared store utilities select the entry matching the
catalog module ID. If it is missing, the manager falls back to the catalog's
`asset_name` latest-release URL.

Optional fields: `install_path`, `name`, `description`, `requires`, `post_install`, `repo_url`. Fields like `name`, `description`, and `requires` in `release.json` override their catalog equivalents.

The release workflow should auto-update `release.json` on each tagged release (see the workflow template above for an example).

### How installation works

1. Fetches `module-catalog.json` from the main branch
2. For each module, fetches `release.json` from the module's GitHub repo (on `default_branch`)
3. Compares `release.json` version to installed version
4. Downloads tarball from `release.json`'s `download_url`
5. Extracts tarball to category subdirectory (e.g., `modules/sound_generators/<id>/`)

### Component Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `sound_generator` | Synthesizers and samplers that produce audio |
| `audio_fx` | Audio effects that process audio |
| `midi_fx` | MIDI effects that transform MIDI |
| `overtake` | Overtake modules (full UI control) |
| `utility` | Utility modules |

## Host Updates

The Schwung host is updated through Schwung Manager, the same place modules are. There is no on-device update surface: `[Check Updates]` used to scan the catalog and list what was outdated, then send you to the manager to install any of it — and the manager shows that same list beside the button that acts on it.

### Releasing a Host Update

1. **Bump the version** in `src/host/version.txt`:
   ```
   1.0.1
   ```

2. **Build and package**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build.sh
   ```

3. **Create a GitHub release** with the tarball:
   ```bash
   gh release create v1.0.1 schwung.tar.gz --title "v1.0.1" --notes "Release notes here"
   ```

4. **Update the catalog** in `module-catalog.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "host": {
       "name": "Schwung",
       "github_repo": "charlesvestal/schwung",
       "asset_name": "schwung.tar.gz",
       "latest_version": "1.0.1",
       "min_host_version": "1.0.0"
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Push the catalog update**:
   ```bash
   git add module-catalog.json
   git commit -m "Update host to v1.0.1"
   git push
   ```

### How Host Updates Work

1. Schwung Manager fetches `module-catalog.json` from the main branch
2. Fetches `release.json` from the host repo for the latest version and download URL
3. Compares to installed version in `/data/UserData/schwung/host/version.txt`
4. If different, shows "Update Host" option with version numbers
5. Update downloads the tarball and extracts over the existing installation
6. User must restart Schwung for changes to take effect

### Catalog Location

The catalog is fetched from:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/charlesvestal/schwung/main/module-catalog.json
```
